It is a beauty like that of kittens, or very small downy ducks making gentle rippling noises with their soft bills, or babies just beginning to toddle and to engage in conscious mischief--a beauty with which you can never be angry, but that you feel ready to crush for inability to comprehend the state of mind into which it throws you. Hetty Sorrel's was that sort of beauty.\" \"It is of little use for me to tell you that Hetty's cheek was like a rose--petal, that dimples played about her pouting lips, that her large dark eyes hid a soft roguishness under their long lashes, and that her curly hair, though all pushed back under her round cap while she was at work, stole back in dark delicate rings on her forehead, and about her white shelllike ears; it is of little use for me to say how lovely was the contour of her pink-and-white neckerchief, tucked into her low plum-coloured stuff boddice, or how the linen butter-making apron, with its bib, seemed a thing to be imitated in silk by duchesses, since it fell in such charming lines, or how her brown stockings and thick-soled buckled shoes lost all that clumsiness which they must certainly have had when empty of her foot and ankle; of little use, unless you have seen a woman who affected you as Hetty affected her beholders, for otherwise, though you might conjure up the image of a lovely woman, she would not in the least resemble that distracting kittenlike maiden ... Hetty's was a spring-tide beauty; it was the beauty of young frisking things, round-limbed, gambolling, circumventing you by a false air of innocence.\" Although she has been brought up by Mr. Poyser as if she had been his own daughter, she is incapable of feeling any gratitude and affection for him or his family. Her beauty attracts village suitors, including honest Adam Bede, whom her uncle favours, but she believes that her beauty destines her for a higher station. When she attracts the attention of the young squire, Arthur Donnithome, she sees a rosy future for herself, ignorantly thinking that his passion, to which she has secretly yielded, must end in marriage. When Arthur Donnithome breaks off his affair with her she is humiliated and sick at heart, but, later, seeing nothing better in the future, promises to marry Adam who is in ignorance of what her real relations with Arthur have been. As the time for their marriage approaches, Hetty realizes that the truth must soon come to light, and, under pretence of visiting Dinah Morris at Snowfield, journeys to Windsor to find Arthur Donnithome and then not finding him, journeys back in despair, lacking the courage to kill herself, but determined to keep her disgrace from her family. On her way back her baby is born. She leaves it in a wood to die, and is arrested for child-murder, tried and sentenced to death. Through her trial and sentence she maintains a hard, obstinate silence, which breaks down only when Dinah Morris goes to her in prison and spends the last night in her cell, pleading with her to confess. Dinah accompanies her to the place of execution, and at the last minute Hetty's sentence is commuted to transportation, from which she never returns. While Hetty herself is not a portrait, her tragedy, and, indeed, the germ of the plot of Adam Bede, were taken from a dramatic experience in the life of George Eliot's aunt, Elizabeth Evans (\"Dinah Morris\"). An ignorant girl, Mary Voce, had been tried at the Nottingham Assizes for child-murder, and had been sentenced to death. She had refused obstinately to confess her crime, and Mrs. Evans visited her in her cell, prayed over her all night, induced her to confess, and then rode with her to the place of execution and stayed with her until she was hanged.

The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance, like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the wind among the autumn boughs.\" He is opposed to the \" Methodisses \" who will, he fears, get the upper hand in the parish if the Squire and rector are not more active against them, and is frequently at odds about the church service with Bartle Massey, the schoolmaster, who is his chief rival in the church choir."

The family likeness between her and her niece Dinah Morris, with the contrast between her keenness and Dinah's seraphic gentleness of expression, might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and Mary. Their eyes were just of the same colour, but a striking test of the difference in their operation was seen in the\ndemeanour of Trip, the black--andtan terrier, whenever that muchsuspected dog unwarily exposed himself to the freezing arctic ray of Mrs. Poyser's glance. Her tongue was not lees keen than her eye, and, whenever a damsel came within earshot, seemed to take up an unfinished lecture, as a barrel-organ takes up a tune, precisely at the point where it had left off.\" \"She has the spirit of three men, with that pale face of hers; and she says such sharp things, too.\" \"Sharp I yes, her tongue is like a new-set razor. She's quite original in her talk, too; one of those untaught wits that help to stock a country with proverbs. I told you that capital thing I heard her say about Craig--that he was like a cock who thought the sun had risen to hear him crow. Now that's an Aesop's fable in a sentence.\" She is a pattern dairywoman and housekeeper, with standards of excellence which none of her much-berated maids, even under the spur of her sharp tongue, ever succeeds in living up to. She keeps her eyes open for her neighbours' foibles and weaknesses, summing them up in keen, though homely, epigrams, and is strict with her husband's niece, Hetty Sorrel, whom she rightly suspects of selfishness and vanity. When the parsimonious Squire Donnithorne tries to impose upon her good-natured husband, Mrs. Poyser \"speaks her mind, to the Squire, routing him in a battle of words which delights the whole neighbourhood. In spite of her sharp tongue she is a kindly woman, much attached to her family and fond of her niece Dinah Morris, whose saintliness she appreciates though she does not approve of her Methodism and self-denial. For several of Mrs. Poyser's traits\u2014her kindliness, shrewd common sense, and witty tongue \u2014George Eliot's own mother, Mrs. Robert Evans (Christiana Pearson) was the original. Mr. John W. Cross, in George Eliot's Life, describes Mrs. Robert Evans as a \"woman with an unusual amount of force\u2014a shrewd practical person, with a considerable dash of the Mrs. Poyser vein in her.\" Cross, vol. 1, p. 13. The name Poyser was a real name in the neighbourhood of Ellastone (the \"Hayslope\" of Adam Bede), and an actual Mrs. Poyser, a farmer's wife, is said to have lived there at the time when George Eliot's father, Robert Evans, was still in Ellastone. A writer in Notes and Queries, whose father had been clerk to William Evans, George Eliot's uncle, states that a Mrs. Poyser was Mr. William Evans' housekeeper, which might explain the use of the name. (See Notes and Queries, Ser. vi, vol. 8, p. 351.)"

Mr. Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg, and suspected that the growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs, had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human calf.

There was no keenness in the eyes; they seemed rather to be shedding love than making observations; they had the liquid look which tells that the mind is full of what it has to give out, rather than impressed by external objects. She stood with her left hand towards the descending sun, and leafy boughs screened her from its rays; but in this sober light the delicate colouring of her face seemed to gather a calm vividness, like flowers at evening. It was a small oval face, of a uniform transparent whiteness, with an egg-like line of cheek and chin, a full but firm mouth, a delicate nostril, and a low perpendicular brow, burmounted by a rising arch of parting between smooth locks of pale reddish hair. The hair was drawn straight back behind the ears, and covered, except for an inch or two, above the brow, by a net Quaker cap. The eyebrows, of the same colour as the hair, were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled; the eyelashes, though no darker, were long and abundant; nothing was left blurred or unfinished. It was one of those faces that make one think of white flowers with light touches of colour on their pure petals. The eyes had no peculiar beauty, beyond that of expression; they looked so simple, so candid, so gravely loving, that no accusing scowl, no light sneer could help melting away before their glance.\" She lives at Snowfield, where she works in a mill, but at the opening of the story she is visiting her aunt at Hayslope, where she preaches movingly on the village Green. Seth Bede has long been in love with her, but Adam Bede has never seen her until, at the time of his father's death, she comes to his cottage to help his grief-stricken mother. Her sense of religious duty causes her to try to lead vain little Hetty Sorrel to a higher life, and while she produces no religious impression on Hetty, she leaves with her a sense of love which makes the girl turn to her later in her despair. Dinah is away from home when Hetty is tried for murder and sentenced to death, but she hurries to Hetty's prison as soon as the news reaches her, and there prays and talks with the stricken girl until she touches her heart and induces her to make the confession which she had obstinately refused to make. She goes with Hetty to the place of execution, and is with her when the reprieve arrives at the last minute. When his grief about Hetty has been somewhat softened, Adam Bede discovers that he is in love with Dinah, and eventually she marries him. The original of Dinah\nMorris was Elizabeth Evans, the wife of George Eliot's uncle, Samuel Evans, al though, as George Eliot herself says, the character is not an exact portrait. Mrs. Evans, whom George Eliot speaks of as \"my Methodist Aunt Samuel\", was an eloquent and well-known Wesleyan preacher, and some of her characteristics and experiences appear in Dinah Morris. One of Elizabeth Evans's striking experiences, when she induced an ignorant girl who had been convicted of child-murder to make a confession, and afterwards rode in the cart with her to the place of execution, gave George Eliot the idea for the climax of Adam Bede. Her connexion with Dinah Morris has been commemorated in the table erected to her memory in the Ebenezer Wesleyan Chapel in Wirksworth (\"Snowfield\") which reads \"Elizabeth Evans, known to the world as Dinah Bede\". (See Cross, George Eliot's Life, vol. 2, pp. 65-7 ; for a detailed account of the life of Elizabeth Evans, see Mottram, True story of George Eliot in relation to Adam Bede.)"

This gentle expression was the more interesting because the schoolmaster's nose, an irregular aquiline twisted a little on one side, had rather a formidable character ; and ids brow, more over, had that peculiar tension which always impresses one as a sign of a keen impatient temperament : the blue veins stood out like cords under the transparent yellow skin, and this intimidating brow was softened by no tendency to baldness, for the grey bristly hair, cut down to about an inch in length, stood round it in as close ranks as ever.\" He is a man of ability and education who has been made a crabbed woman-hater by some experience of his youth. He is at odds with Joshua Bann on the subject of church music, and often comments sharply on Hayslope doings and sayings.

He had never yet forfeited that approbation, and he had considerable reliance on his own virtues. No young man could oonfees his faults more candidly; candour was one of his favourite virtues; and how can a man's candour be seen in all its lustre unless he has a few failings to talk of?

As a boy he was much attached to Adam Bede, and this friendship continues after Arthur is grown up, causing him to plan the many things which he will do for Adam when he inherits the estate. At the opening of the story he is invalided home from his regiment with a broken arm, and beguiles the tedium of his inaction by noticing pretty Hetty Sorrel, not knowing that Adam Bede is courting her. Finding that her attraction is becoming too strong, he resolves to break away, but cannot keep his good resolution and ends by really falling in love with her, without any idea on his part of marriage, although Hetty believes that he will marry her. When Adam finds Hetty and Arthur together, he and Arthur fight, and the latter, forced to it by Adam who does not know how far things have gone, writes a letter to Hetty breaking off their relationship, but telling her how to reach him if she needs him, and then joins his regiment. When he learns that Adam and Hetty are to be married he is relieved that the affair has ended so well, and salves his conscience with the thought of the kind things that he means to do for them. His remorse is great when, called home by his grandfather's death, he learns that Hetty is being tried on the charge of murdering his child and hers. At the very last minute he succeeds in having her sentence of death commuted to transportation, and then exiles himself from home, to the army on the Contment."

The sleeve rolled up above the elbow showed an arm that was likely to win the prize for feats of strength ; yet the long supple hand, with its broad finger tips, looked ready for works of skill. In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon, and justified his name ; but the jetblack hair, made the more notice able by its contrast with the light paper cap, and the keen glance of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly marked, prominent and mobile eyebrows, indicated a mixture of Celtic blood. The face was large and roughly hewn, and when in repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an expression of good-humoured honest intelligence.\" Poverty and his father's bad habits had given him much to contend against, but with a strong will he had overcome obstacles, gained an education in Bartle Massey's night school, and made himself a capable artisan, respected by his neighbours for his ability and upright character. At the beginning of the story he is chief workman in Jonathan Burge'a timber yard, with proapects of a partnership eome day, especially if he is willing to marry gentle Mary Burge. He has ideas about timber, and his friend Arthur Donnithome , the heir of the manor, for whom Adam entertains a strong friendship dating from their boyhood, intends to put Adam in charge of the Donnithome woods whenever the old aquire dies. He ie deeply in love with shallow Hetty Sorrel, the village beauty, who, however, ignores him, aa her head has been turned by attentions from Arthur Donnithome. When Adam finds that Arthur has been making love to Hetty, he fights Arthur, in spite of his strong affection for him, and forces him to break with Hetty, not knowing how far the relations between the two had gone. Later Adam becomes engaged to Hetty, but she runs away just before the date set for the wedding. When he learns that she has been arrested and is to be tried for child-murder Adam is overwhelmed with despair, and with rage against Arthur. He stands by Hetty in court, but is implacable against Arthur for a time, although later, won over by Arthur's genuine remorse, he consents to remain on the estate. Eventually he marries Dinah Morris. It is generally agreed that the character of Adam Bede and some of the incidents of hie career are drawn from Robert Evans, George Eliot's father. There are many points of resemblance in character and circumstances, and George Eliot herself admitted this, although she said that Adam was not a portrait of her father. There was the same kind of friendship between Robert Evans and young Francis Newdigate as between Adam Bede and Arthur Donnithorne."

It is a very fine old place, of red brick, softened by a pale powdery lichen, which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity, so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limest.one ornaments surrounding the three gables, the windows, and the door-place. But the windows are patched with wooden panes, and the door, I think, is like the gateit is never opened: how it would groan and grate against the stone floor if it were! For it is a solid, heavy, handeome door, and must once have been in the habit of shutting with a sonorous bang behind a liveried lackey, who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair. . . But at present one might fancy the house in the early stage of a chancery suit and that the fruit from that grand double row of walnut-trees on the right hand of the enclosure would fall and rot among the grass.\" The Hall Farm furnishes the setting for several of the important scenes in Adam Bede. Hetty Sorrel lives there with her aunt and Uncle Poyser, and Dinah Morris stays there when she is at Hayslope. It is in the farm dairy that Arthur Donnithorne sees Hetty, and in the garden, much later, Adam Bede and Hetty become engaged. In the Hall Farm kitchen Mrs. Poyser \"has her say out\" with her landlord, Squire Donnithorne, and in the kitchen, also, the Harvest Home supper is celebrated. While several originals of the Hall Farm have been suggested, the balance of opinion is in favour of Corley Hall, an old Jacobean house about four miles from Coventry and not far from George Eliot's childhood home at Nuneaton. The description of Corley Hall agrees in the main with that of the Hall Farm, except that the lionesses on the gatepost are griffins. Some remains of the \"fine double row of walnut-trees \" may still be seen, though many have fallen. The description of the Hall Farm garden may possibly have been taken from George Eliot's own garden at Griff House."

The fine old remnant stood a little backward and under the shadow of tall beeches.\" The house and the woods of the Chase are the scene of several of the main events of the story. Arthur Donnithorne's coming-ofage festivities are held there, Arthur and Hetty meet in the woods and the little Hermitage, the fight between Arthur and Adam Bede takes place there, and after Hetty's trial it is in the Chase and the Hermitage that Arthur and Adam meet again and are reconciled. The original of Donnithome Chase was Wooton Hall, near Ellastone, the estate of Francis Parker Newdigate, on which George Eliot's father, Robert Evans (\"Adam Bede\") began his career as land agent. Another house near Ellastone, Calwich Abbey, has sometimes been suggested as the original, possibly merely because of its name. Wooton Hall is a low stone mansion built about 1730. In 1766 J. J. Rousseeau stayed there."

That's what I've heard Squire Donnithorne say many a time; it's the dileck, says he.\" George Eliot's use of dialect is both accurate and artistic. While all dialect words and phrases used are scrupulously correct, they are introduced only in so far as is needed to give the right local colour, and not in such numbers as to affect the intelligibility for the ordinary reader. The dialects used in the various novels are: Adam Bede, the dialect of North Staffordshire and the neighbouring part of Derbyshire; Scenes of Clerical Life, Silas Marner, and, in general, the other provincial novels, the dialect of North Warwickshrie. The above dialects do not differ greatly from the Leicestershire dialect and practically all of George Eliot's dialect words are given in Evans' Leicestershire words.

        "desc": "Adam Bede is a picture of English village life at the end of the eighteenth century, bringing into the canvas life-like portraits of artisan, village worthy, tenant fanner, Wesleyan preacher, rector, and squire. The outstanding figures are: Adam Bede, the honest craftsman; Mrs. Poysei, of keen eye and pungent, homely humour; Dinah Morris, the Methodist ; and Hetty Sorrel, one of George Eliot's many studies in egoism. The climax of the plot\u2014Hetty's crime and trial, and her confession to Dinah Morris\u2014was suggested by an experience of the real Dinah, George Eliot's \"Methodist Aunt Samuel\", in which she had brought to confession an ignorant girl sentenced to death for child murder. Throughout, the book contains much in both characters and descriptions that is reminiscent of the early residence of Robert Evans and other members of his family in Staffordshire. Adam Bede, a young carpenter of ability and force of character, has made his way against odds to the position of foreman of Jonathan Burge's timber yard, in Hayslope. He might even marry his employer's daughter, but he has eyes for no one except Hetty Sorrel, the shallow little beauty of Hayslope, who lives with her uncle, Martin Poyser, a substantial farmer. Mrs. Poyser's niece, Dinah Morris, a saintly young Methodist preacher, visits at the Poysers' and preaches on the village Green. Seth, Adam's brother, is in love with Dinah. Grieved at Hetty's worldliness, Dinah tries unsuccessfully to turn her thoughts to higher things. One of Adam Bede's warmest friends is Arthur Donnithorne, the old Squire's heir, a generous, impulsive young man, popular with the tenantry. Attracted by Hetty's beauty, Arthur visits Mrs. Poyser's dairy to talk with Hetty. Later they meet frequently in the woods of Donnithorne Chase, and Arthur, though he makes a feeble effort to break away from her attraction, ends by falling in love with her, ignorant of the fact that his friend Adam is courting her. Hetty, believing that he means to marry her and make her lady of the manor, yields entirely to his passion. Adam finds Arthur and Hetty together in the woods and forces Arthur to fight. Ignorant of how far matters have gone, Adam reproaches Arthur with putting wrong ideas into Hetty's head, and makes him promise to write a letter to Hetty breaking off the affair. Arthur allows Adam to believe that it has been merely a flirtation, and writes the letter to Hetty, giving her, however, an address at which she can find him, in case she needs his help, and then goes away to join his regiment. Hetty, miserable over the end of her day-dream, comes to think of Adam as the best that is left her, and eventually promises to marry him. The wedding is set for early spring, but the Poysers meanwhile are worrying over their own affairs, as the inimitable Mrs. Poyser has offended the stingy old Squire with her caustic statement of some home truths, and they fear that he will give them notice to quit the farm, which their family has held for generations. Ab the time of the wedding approaches, Hetty, realizing that she cannot much longer conceal her condition, thinks of suicide, but lacks the courage to kill herself. She leaves home on pretence of visiting Dinah Morris at Snowfield, but goes instead by a devious route to Windsor, the address which Arthur Donnithorne had given her. Finding that Arthur has gone with his regiment to Ireland, she turns back in despair with a vague idea of throwing herself on Dinah Morris, whose friendliness she remembers. On the way back her child is born in a strange house, where she has sought lodgings. Adam, meanwhile, believing that Hetty is visiting Dinah, is happily making preparations for their wedding. When he goes to Snowfield to bring Hetty back from her supposed visit, he finds that she has never been there, and after searching for her for a time returns to bring the news to the Poysers. Mr. Irwine, the rector, learns that Hetty has been arrested for child-murder and is awaiting trial in Stoniton jail. Hetty, terrified and dazed, maintains at her trial a sullen silence which alienates sympathy, and obstinately refuses to confess even after she has been found guilty and condemned to death. Dinah Morris goes to Stoniton to try to help Hetty, stays with her in her cell, softens her heart, and persuades her to confess. On the last day Dinah rides in the cart with Hetty to the place of execution, but at the last moment Hetty's sentence is commuted to transportation. Her reprieve has been brought by Arthur Donnithorne, who, overwhelmed on his return from Ireland by the news of Hetty's tragedy, has bent every effort to saving her life. The Poysers and Adam Bede plan to move away from the lands of the man who has deeply injured them, but finally agree to stay when Arthur, deeply repentant, exiles himself to the army on the Continent. After time has healed his feeling about Hetty, Adam finds that he loves Dinah Morris. Though she at first refuses him, she realizes later that her feeling for him is too strong for them to remain apart, and they are married.

David Faux, in order to go to the West Indies to make his fortune, steals his mother's hoard of twenty guineas, but before he can make way with it is seen by his idiot brother Jacob. To divert Jacob's attention, David tells him that guineas turn into yellow lozenges, and wins the idiot's inconvenient love by giving him the sweetmeats. After six years in Jamaica, where instead of making a fortune he works as a cook, David returns to England, and under the name of Edward Freely establishes himself as a confectioner in the little town of Grimworth, passing himself off as a scion of a good family, the nephew of a fictitious Admiral Freely. The convenience of his cooked food demoralizes the good housewives of Grimworth, and David prospers, gains quite a reputation as a great traveller of many adventures, and succeeds in becoming engaged to pretty Penny Palfrey, the young daughter of the richest farmer in the neighbourhood. He makes the mistake, however, of claiming a small legacy which his father had left him, and this recalls him to the mind of the idiot brother with the sweet tooth. When David is entertaining his fiancee and her family, brother Jacob appears, raids the supply of lozenges, and claims relationship with \" Mr. Freely \". David's real name and his theft are discovered, and he loses his bride and has to leave Grimworth. Additional information: First published in the Cornhill Magazine, vol. x, pp. 1-32, July, 1864.

When he marries, he has only daughters, and so gradually gives to his ward the affection that he would have given a son, ignorant of the fact that the secrecy maintained about his parentage has made Daniel believe that he is Sir Hugo's illegitimate son. He wishes Daniel to enter English public life, and when the latter, after his parentage and race are revealed to him, by his unknown mother, elects to call himself a Jew and work for his race, Sir Hugo is disappointed but is too genuinely attached to Daniel to oppose him."

Lush's love of ease was well satisfied at present, and if his puddings were rolled towards him in the dust, he took the inside bits and found them relishing.\" He schemes to have Grandcourt many the rich Miss Arrowpoint, and disapproves of his attentions to Gwendolen Harleth. Failing to influence Grandcourt, he arranges to have Mrs. Glasher see Gwendolen, hoping that the story of Mrs. Glasher's relations with Grandcourt may drive Gwendolen to refuse him. From the beginning Gwendolen feels a marked antipathy for Mr. Lush, and when she marries Grandcourt her influence banishes him for awhile, but he is eventually recalled, and is the one deputed to tell Gwendolen of the disagreeable provisions in her husband's will."

Was the good or the evil genius dominant in those beams ? Probably the evil ; else why was the effect that of unrest rather than of undisturbed charm ? . . . The Nereid in sea-green robes and silver ornaments, with a pale sea-green feather fastened in silver falling backward over her green hat and light-brown hair, was Gwendolen Harleth.\" \"Having always been the pet and pride of the household, waited on by mother, sisters, governess, and maids, as if she had been a princess in exile, she naturally found it difficult to think her own pleasure less important than others made it, and when it was positively thwarted, felt an astonished resentment, apt, in her cruder days, to vent itself in one of those passionate acts which look like a contradiction of habitual tendencies . . . Gwendolen's nature was not remorseless, but she liked to make her penances easy.\" \"She meant to do what was pleasant to herself in a striking manner ; or, rather, whatever she could do so as to strike others with admiration and get in that reflected way a more ardent sense of living, seemed pleasant to her fancy. . .\" \"In her beauty, a certain unusualness about her, a decision of will which made itself felt in her graceful movements and clear unhesitating tones . . . However, she had the charm, and those who feared her were also fond of her ; the fear and the fondness being perhaps both heightened by what may be called the irridescence of her character \u2014the play of various, nay, contrary tendencies.\" Her beauty and aloofness attract the rich Mallinger Grandcourt, and she is about ready to accept him when she learns that he ought to marry Mrs. Glasher. Promising Mrs. Glasher not to marry Grandcourt, she goes away to escape his attentions, gambles at Leubronn, where she is influenced by seeing Daniel Deronda as she is losing, and is called home by the news that all her mother's property has been lost. As the only way of earning money herself which she can find is a hated position as governess, she marries Grandcourt in spite of her promise to Mrs. Glasher, attempting to quiet her conscience by the plea that she is doing it for her mother, to whom she is really attached. The false position in which she finds herself soon makes her unhappy, and she turns to Daniel Deronda, whose effect on her at Leubronn she has not forgotten, for spiritual aid, thereby arousing her husband's resentment and jealousy. Grandcourt's cruel and contemptuous attitude so arouses her hatred that she trifles with the idea that she could kill him, and when he is drowned before her eyes, she feels that her momentary delay in throwing him a rope makes her a murderess. In her remorse and despair she turns to Deronda as her only help, and from him gradually attains the beginning of a new spiritual attitude and unselfishness. When George Eliot was at Homburg in 1872 she was much impressed by a young lady whom she saw gambling there. This incident furnished the model for Gwendolen Harleth's gambling at Leubronn.

In a minor degree this is nothing un common, but in the Princess the acting had a rare perfection of physiognomy, voice, and gesture.\" Brought up by a stern and orthodox father who believed intensely in his race and in the inferiority of women, she had come to hate both his authority and the thought of being a Jewess. At her father's wish she had married her cousin Charisi, but had bent his gentle nature to her will and had gone on the stage, where her wonderful voice and acting made her the leading prima donna of her time. With all her ambition centred on a great career she had no love for her baby (Daniel), and after her husband's early death she persuaded Sir Hugo Mallinger, one of her admirers, to take Daniel to England and bring him up in ignorance of his birth. Some time after, thinking that her voice was failing, she married the Prince Halm-Eberstein and retired from the stage. Believing that she had done the best thing for Daniel in having him brought up as a Christian Englishman, she had never intended to reveal herself to him, but when suffering from an incurable disease she becomes conscience stricken at the thought that she has thwarted her father's desire to have a grandson, and summons Deronda to meet her at Genoa, where she makes her self and his race known to him without responding in any way to the affection which he offers her. In his Life and Writings of Isaac Disraeli, by his Son, Benjamin Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield, gives an account of Isaac Disraeli's mother, which in some respects, particularly her intense resentment of her race and its social disadvantages and her lack of affection for her son, so resembles the Princess Halm-Eberstein, that it seems probable that George Eliot must have taken some touches in the portrait of Deronda's mother, and in the scene be tween mother and son, from this original.

He comes to Diplow with some idea of courting the rich Miss Arrowpoint, but is attracted by Gwendolen Harleth's beauty and independence, and, led on by the fact that she holds him off and even goes away to escape his attentions, makes up his mind to marry her. For a while he feels as much liking for her as his worn-out nature permits, but her attitude toward Deronda, innocent though it is, arouses his jealousy and he determines to break her spirit and bend her to his idea of what his wife should be, heedless of the hatred which this arouses in her. He is drowned in the Mediterranean, on a boating trip which he had forced her into taking, and leaves a will which gives his estates to his illegitimate son by Mrs. Glasher and a mere pittance to Gwendolen."

Look at his hands... they are long, flexible, firmly grasping hands, such as Titian has painted in a picture where he wanted to show the combination of refinement with force. And there is something of a likeness, too, between the faces belonging to the hands--in both the uniform pale-brown skin, the perpendicular brow, the calmly penetrating eyes.\" \"His eyes had a peculiarity which has drawn many men into trouble; they were of a dark yet mild intensity, which seemed to express a special interest in every one on whom he fixed them, and might easily help to bring on him those claims which ardently sympathetic people are often creating in the minds of those who need help.\" \"To say that Deronda was romantic would be to misrepresent him; but under his calm and somewhat self-repressed exterior there was a fervour which made him easily find poetry and romance among the events of every-day life.\" As a child he had been brought to England by Sir Hugo and educated as one of his own family. He is sensitive about his ignorance of his parentage, though much attached to Sir Hugo whom he believes to be his father, and his equivocal position makes him restless and unsettled. At the opening of the story he sees Gwendolen Harleth gambling at Leubronn, and his disapproval disturbs her then and influences her later, when, after her return to England, she marries Grandcourt, Sir Hugo's nephew, and she and Deronda are thus thrown together in the same social circle. While rowing on the Thames Deronda saves Mirah Cohen, a beautiful Jewess who is attempting suicide, finding a refuge for her with his friends the Meyricks and continuing to watch over her. In his efforts to trace Mirah's lost brother, Ezra, he forms a strong friendship with Mordecai Cohen, becomes interested in Jewish questions through him, and eventually discovers that Mordecai is Mirah's brother Ezra and falls in love with Mirah. Meanwhile he feels a different kind of interest in Gwendolen who, in the unhappiness of her marriage, appeals to him for advice and guidance. When his acquaintance with Mordecai and Mirah has thoroughly aroused his interest in the Jews, he is summoned to Genoa to meet his hitherto unknown mother, the Princess Halm-Eberstein, learns from her that he is a Jew, and rejoices in the information. While he is still at Genoa, Grandcourt is drowned in the Mediterranean, and Deronda supports Gwendolen in her remorse and despair, and later she turns to him as her one source of help. On his return to England he devotes himself to work for the Jews, marries Mirah, and with her goes to Palestine to try to realize Mordecai's dream of a revival of Jewish nationalism. According to Sir Leslie Stephen, Edmund Gurney (1847-1888) may have been, in sorne respects at least, the original of Daniel Deronda. Deronda's personal appearance was taken from the Christ in Titian's picture, the \"Tribute Money\", which haunted George Eliot for years after she had seen it in the Dresden gallery.

Then see the perfect cameo her profile maeks, cut in a duskish shell where by some happy fortune there pierced a gem-like darkness for the eye and eyebrow; the delicate nostrils defined enough to be ready for sensitive movements, the finished ear, the firm curves of the chin and neck entering into the expression of a refinement which was not feebleness.\" When she was a young child her father, an actor, had taken her away from her mother and brother, and for many years they led a Bohemian life distasteful to Mirah, who was strongly attached to the Jewish faith. In order to escape the dishonourable attentions of a man seconded by her father, she runs away from her father and comes to London to seek her mother and brother. Unsuccessful in her search, worn out and penniliess, she attempts to drown herself in the Thames, but is rescued by Daniel Deronda, and taken to Mrs. Meyrick. Here her voice, which has been carefully trained, supports her, and when her brother Ezra, or Mordecai, is found she cares for him tenderly until his death. Shortly before Mordecai's death she and Daniel Deronda are married."

It was a finely typical Jewish face, wrought into intensity of expression apparently by a strenuous eager experience in which all the satisfaction had been indirect and far off, and perhaps by some bodily suffering also, which involved that absence of ease in the present. The feature were clear-cut, not large; the brow not high, but broad, and fully defined by the crisp black hair. It might never have been a particularly handsome face, but it must always have been forcible.\" \"A man steeped in poverty and obscurity, weakened by disease, consciously within the shadow of advancing death, but living an intense life in an invisible past and future, careless of his personal lot, except for its possibly making some obstruction to a conceived good which he would never share except as a brief inward vision--a day afar off, whose sun would never warm him, but into which he threw his sou's desire, with a passion often wanting to the personal motives of healthy youth.\" His whole life is wrapped up in his belief in the regeneration of a great Jewish nationality in Palestine if only the right leader of the race can be found. As a young man he had started east to work in Palestine, when he was recalled because his mother needed his help after her husband had deserted her. The need of caring for his mother and the consumption which he develops from exposure make him give up the idea of his own leadership, and when Daniel Deronda meets him he is living in semi-poverty as a watch mender in the Cohen pawnshop and an off-hour attendant in Mr. Ram's book shop, constantly hoping to find the leader on whom his mantle can descend. He sees in Deronda this destined leader, introduces Deronda to the Philosphers' Club at the \"Hand and Banner\", and rouses his keen interest both in the Jewish race and in the thought that he may be a Jew himself. Throught Deronda's instrumentality, his relationship to Mirah is discovered, and after Deronda and Mirah are married he dies happy in the belief that they will realize his dream. The original of Mordecai was a Jewish journeyman watchmaker, name Cohn, or Kohn, who was president of a philosophical club in Red Lion Square, which G. H. Lewes frequented in his youth, and which he describes in the Fortnightly Review, vol. 4, p. 386. To the personal characteristics of this Cohn, as Lewes described him, George Eliot added the belief in a renewed Jewish nationality, which she is said to have taken from a Moldavian Jew possessed of the same idea whom she met in Munich. (See Dictionary of National Biography, article Lewes; Acton, Historical Essays, p. 300.)"

Deronda, not in a cheerful mood, was rahsly pronouncing this Ezra Cohen to be the most unpoetic Jew he had ever met with in books or life; his phraseology was as little as possible like that of the Old Testament; and no shadow of a Suffering Race distinguished his vulgarity of soul from that of a prosperous pink-and-white huckster of the purest English lineage.\" Daniel Deronda at first mistakes him for Mirah's brother, Ezra, for whome he is searching, and so introduces himself to the Cohen family. He and his family are kind-hearted, commonplace Jews, who care for Mordecai (the other Ezra Cohen) in his illness and poverty."

        "desc": "Daniel Deronda is a novel of two distinct themes and stories, presenting on the one hand a picture of Jewish life and character and of the Jewish aspiration for the restoration of a separate national existence and culture, and on the other, a study of selfishness in the character of Gwendolen Harleth, who, through suffering and the consciousness of wrong doing, is saved \"as by fire\" and regenerated into the beginning of something better. The two stories touch in the character of Daniel Deronda, in whom Mordecai, the Jew, sees the restorer of his race, and in whom Gwendolen Harleth finds the saving force which changes her philosophy of life. Gwendolen Harleth, a beauty, who has been spoiled by an adoring family, is ambitious for a distinguished position. She has no fortune, so she expects to marry someone who can give her the position and consideration to which she thinks that she is entitled, and at the same time appreciate her superiority enough to let her lead him in everything. Though selfish, she is not entirely heartless. When Sir Hugo Mallinger's nephew, the rich Henleigh Grandcourt, a blase, middle-aged autocrat, first sees Gwendolen, he admires her beauty. Piqued by her aloofness, he pays her marked court and intends to marry her. Mrs. Glasher, Grandcourt's discarded mistress, tells Gwendolen that Grandcourt ought to marry her and legitimize her four children. Gwendolen promises Mrs. Glasher not to marry Grandcourt, and goes with friends to the Continent to avoid him. At Leubronn she gambles and begins to lose as soon as she sees that Daniel Deronda is watching her with disapproval instead of with the admiration which she excites in others. Deronda, a handsome man with many virtues and no vices, has been brought up by Sir Hugo Mallinger as his nephew, though he himself believes that he is Sir Hugo's natural son. This belief, though it does not Jessen in any way his affection for Sir Hugo, has made him somewhat detached and aloof. From Leubronn Gwendolen is called home suddenly by the loss of her mother's small fortune, and finds that she must do something to earn money. The thought of a position as governess is so distasteful to her that she breaks her promise to Mrs. Glasher, and, when Grandcourt renews his suit, accepts him, assuring herself that she does it for her mother's sake, and feeling sure that Grandcourt will always be led by her. On the day of her wedding she receives a bitter letter from Mrs. Glasher which throws her into hysterics. Unwilling to injure Mrs. Glasher still further, she conceals from Grandcourt the reason for her agitation, and their married life starts with irritation on his side and unhappiness on hers. While visiting at Sir Hugo Mallinger's, Gwendolen meets Deronda again, and, anxious to justify herself in bis eyes, makes opportunities of talking to him, gradually coming under the influence of his higher idealism, taking him as a sort of spiritual guide. Grandcourt, a selfish tyrant who has never permitted the slightest opposition on the part of any of his dependents, objects to bis wife's evident interest in Deronda, and tells her so unpleasantly. Deronda, however, has only a friendly interest in Gwendolen, 88 be baa now found interests in London which absorb him. While boating on the Thames he rescues Mirah Cohen {or Lapidoth), a beautiful and friendless Jewess, from suicide, and takes her to the home of his friends, the Meyricks, until her lost brother Ezra can be found. While seeking this Ezra Cohen, Deronda meets Mordecai, a consumptive Hebrew dreamer, whose idealism and evident liking for Deronda draw Deronda to him. From Mordecai, Deronda learns much about Jewish history and ideals, especially about Mordecai's own dream of a restored Jewish nationality. Eventually a chance remark shows that Mordecai is Mirah's lost brother, Ezra Mordecai Cohen, and Deronda brings together Mordecai, for whom he now feels a strong friendship, and Mirah, whom he is beginning to love. Gwendolen, meantime, is finding only unhappiness in her married life. Instead of the indulgent husband that she expected, Grandcourt had shown himself a tyrant, and, his irritation once aroused, is thwarting her in all her desires and treating her with cruelty. Her unhappiness awakens her conscience, and she feels the need of the spiritual help which Deronda means to her. At times she fancies that she could even kill her husband. Grandcourt starts on a yachting trip on the Mediterranean, forcing Gwendolen to accompany him. At Genoa, Grandcourt's irritation is increased by finding Deronda there. Deronda's presence at Genoa is due to the fact that he had been summoned there to meet his hitherto unknown mother. She proves to be the Princess Halm-Eberstein (formerly a great prima donna, the Alcharisi), a Jewess who hated her race and who had sent her little son to England to be brought up aa a Christian, ignorant of his race. Grandcourt takes Gwendolen, against her will, out in a small sail boat and accidently falls overboard and drown before Gwendolen throws him a rope. Gwendolen, who had delayed for a moment in throwing the rope, believes herself guilty of bis death and jumps in after him, but is rescued. To Deronda she accuses herself of Grandcourt's murder, and finds her only comfort, both then, and after her return to England, in the counsel which he gives her. Grandcourt's will makes Mrs. Glasher's son his heir, and leaves only a small provision for Gwendolen. Deronda, returning to England with the news that he is a Jew, is welcomed with joy by Mordecai and Mirah. He and Mirah marry, and after Mordecai's death, go to Palestine to try to make true hie dream of a restored Jewish nation.

A widower of thirty-four, he returns to England when his brother's death makes him the heir to the Transome estates. Breaking with the family traditions of Toryism, he stands for Parliament as a Radical, and is defeated after an exciting campaign and election. In looking into the estate business management, he finds that Mr. Jermyn, the family lawyer, has taken advantage of his position to his own profit, and starts legal proceedings against him. When he learns that Esther Lyon is the rightful owner of the estate he becomes genuinely interested in her, wants to marry her, but fails to win her love. In a public quarrel Mr. Jermyn tells Harold that he, Jermyn, is his father, and, as a result Harold and his mother leave England for a time."

Her tight-fitting black dress was much worn; the fine lace of her cuffs and collar, and of the small veil which fell backwards over her high comb, was visibly mended; but rare jewels flashed on her hands, which lay on her folded black-clad arms, like finely cut onyx cameos ... \" \"Crosses, mortifications, money cares, conscious blameworthiness, had changed the aspect of the world for her; there was anxiety in the morning sunlight ; there was unkind triumph or disapproving pity in the glances of greeting neighbours . . . Mrs. Transome, whose imperious will had availed little to ward off the great evils of her life, found the opiate for her discontent in the exertion of her will about smaller things. She was not cruel, and could not enjoy thoroughly what she called the old woman's pleasure of tormenting; but she liked every little sign of power her lot had left her. She liked that a tenant should stand bareheaded below her as she sat on horseback. She liked to insist that work done without her orders should be undone from beginning to end ... a woman's keen sensibility and dread ... lay screened behind all her petty habits and narrow notions.\" As a proud young beauty of good family but little money, she had made a loveless marriage with the feeble Mr. Transome. Feeling no fondness for either her husband or her half-idiot eldest son [sic., Mudge & Sears, 1924], she had responded to the attentions of the handsome young lawyer, Jermyn, and later had centred all her love and pride in her second son, Harold, a healthy handsome boy. Her dominating nature makes her enjoy managing the estate in place of her feeble husband, but lawsuits and the charges which the unscrupulous Jermyn has fastened on the estate have greatly reduced the income. \r\nOn the death of her disreputable eldest son she eagerly anticipates Harold's return from the East, where he has gone to make his fortune, and expects to find in his devotion a solace for all her dissatisfactions. She is bitterly disappointed when, instead of this devotion, he gives her merely a good-humoured, condescending affection; feels the loss of authority when he does not defer to her about the management of the estate; and watches with helpless dread the growing antagonism between him and Jermyn. Finally, when Jermyn, in a public quarrel, tells Harold that he is his father, her unhappy secret is revealed to her son. After his first reaction to this shock, Harold treats her with gentleness, and takes her abroad, away from the associations of Transome Court."

His face looked old and worn, yet the curtain of hair that fell from his bald crown and hung about his neck retained much of its original auburn tint, and his large, brown, short-sighted eyes were still clear and bright. At the first glance, every one thought him a very odd-looking rusty old man; the free-school boys often hooted after him and called him \"Revelations\"; and to many respectable church people old Lyon's little legs and large head seemed to make Dissent additionally preposterous. But he was too shortsighted to notice those who tittered at him-too absent from the world of small facts and petty impulses in which titterers live.\" \"Once in his life he had been blinded, deafened, hurried along by rebellious impulse ; he had gone astray after his own desires, and had let the fire die out on the altar ; and as the true penitent, hating his self-besotted error, asks from all coming life duty instead of joy, and service instead of ease, so Rufus was perpetually on the watch lest he should ever again postpone to some private affection a great public opportunity which to him was equivalent to a command.\" Twenty-two years before the opening of the story Rufus Lyon was an eloquent and successful minister of a large Independent Chapel, when Annette Ledru came suddenly into his life. The death of her husband, Maurice Christian Bycliffe, had left her penniless in a strange land, and Mr. Lyon took her and her baby into his home, in spite of the criticism of his congregation, fell deeply in love with her, and gave up his high calling to watch over her and her child. After a time the grateful Annette married him and when she died, three years later, he returned to the ministry, and brought up the baby, Esther, as his own daughter. At the opening of the story he is leading, in humble surroundings, a life of wrapt absorption in his work and loving devotion to Esther, who still believes herself his daughter. When events make him believe that she should no longer be kept in ignorance of her parentage he tells her the full story and leaves her free to decide whether or not she will claim the inheritance and rank to which she is apparently entitled. The original of Rufus Lyon was the Reverend Francis Franklin, a Baptist minister, who for fifty-four years, from 1799 until his death in 1852, was pastor of the Cow Lane Chapel, in Coventry. Mr. Franklin was the father of the Misses Franklin, whose school in Coventry George Eliot attended, and the character of Rufus Lyon is said by those who remembered him, to be a faithful portrait. (See Cross, George Eliot's Life, vol. 1, pp. 24-5; Negri, George Eliot, vol. 2, p. 62; also article in Our Times, June, 1881.)"

He would not observe her, but he had a sense of an elastic walk, the tread of small feet, a long neck, and a high crown of shining brown plaits with curls that floated backward \u2014 things, in short, that suggested a fine lady . . . Esther had that excellent thing in woman, a soft voice with a clear fluent utterance. Her sauciness was always charming, because it was without emphasis, and was accompanied with graceful little turns of the head.\" \"She had one of those exceptional organizations which are quick and sensitive without being in the least morbid ; she was alive to the finest shades of manner, to the nicest distinctions of tone and accent . . . Her own pretty instep, clad in a silk stocking, her little heel, just rising from a kid slipper, her irreproachable nails and delicate wrist, were the objects of delighted consciousness to her; and she felt that it was her superiority which made her unable to use without disgust any but the finest cambric handkerchiefs and freshest gloves. Her money all went in the gratification of these nice tastes, and she saved nothing from her earnings . . . she hated all meanness, would empty her purse impulsively on some sudden appeal to her pity, and if she found out that her father had a want she would supply it with some pretty device of a surprise.\" She had been brought up as the daughter of Rufus Lyon, the Independent minister, and while fond of her father has little sympathy with his simple tastes and life. Through her father she meets Felix Holt. and while at first repelled by his surface roughness, soon becomes interested in him and in the lectures that he gives her. Fearing that she may hear the story from someone else, Rufus Lyon tells her that he is not her real father, and that she is the daughter of Maurice Christian Bycliffe. She is much touched by his story of his devotion and marriage to her mother, and gains a different appreciation of his life and character. Later, after she learns that she is the rightful owner of the Transome estates, she goes to Transome Court to visit Mrs. Transome, and there is courted by Harold Transome. What she sees at Transome Court shows her that wealth does not necessarily bring happiness, and as Felix Holt's trial for manslaughter has opened her eyes to the strength of her real feeling for him, she gives up her claim to the estate to marry Felix. While George Eliot's portrait of Esther Lyon is not autobiographic to anything like the same extent as that of the character of Maggie Tulliver (in Mill on the Floss), there are some things in it--the fastidiousness, niceness about dress, etc.-for which the author's own tastes and habits supplied the original.

He was full of longsuffering towards his unwise mother ... he had chosen to fill his days in a way that required the utmost exertion of patience, that required those little rill-like out-flowings of goodness which in minds of great energy must be fed from deep sources of thought and passionate devotedness. In this way his energies served to make him gentle; and now, in this twenty-sixth year of his life, they had ceased to make him angry, except in the presence of something that roused his deep indignation.\" He has been well educated and could live in comfortalbe and \"respectable\" circumstances, but prefers to give up outside refinements to live in poverty among the people whom he wishes to serve. His father had invented some quack medicines upon the sale of which his widowed mother lived comfortably, but Felix, who knows that the medicines are worthless, forces her to give up selling them, and provides for her himself. Mrs. Holt, who objects strongly to giving up the medicines, asks the Reverend Mr. Lyon to reason with Felix, and through the minister Felix meets Esther, with whom he soon falls in love, although at first he sees only surface qualities and faults about which he lectures her. He is interested in the parliamentary campaign in which Harold Transome is the Radical candidate, and fears that some of the practices which he has seen will result in trouble. When a serious election riot does occur, Felix tries to turn the mob and unintentionally kills a constable. He is tried for manslaughter and sentenced to four years' imprisonment in spite of the testimony of his friends, including Esther Lyon, who is now known to be the rightful possessor of the Transome estates. Eventually he is pardoned and learns that Esther has given up wealth and position because she returns his love. The two are married and move away from Treby. Some features of Felix Holt were drawn from Gerald Massey.the socialist-poet. (See Collins, Studies, p. 148; Diet, nat. biog.) Another original has been suggested in John Farn, of the vicinity of Nuneaton, a ribbon weaver and labour agitator with a gift for oratory. See article in Great Thoughts from Master Minds, March, 1901, pp. 369-70. The description of the election riot was suggested by a riot in Nuneaton which George Eliot herself saw when she was thirteen years old. (See Cross, George Eliot's Life, vol. l, pp. 27-9.)"

Treby Magna gradually passed from being simply a respectable market-town\u2014the heart of agreat rural district, where the trade was only such as had close relations with the local landed interest\u2014and took on the more complex life brought by mines and manufactures.\" It has been suggested that in the original of Treby Magna was the ancient town of Coventry, in Warwickshire, where George Eliot lived for some time, but beyond the fact that there was a Coventry original for Rufus Lyon's chapel, there seems to be nothing to support this suggestion.

John Justus Transome in 1729 had made a settlement of his estates entailing them on his son Thomas and his heirs-male, with remainder to the Bycliffes in fee. Thomas, a prodigal, had sold his own and his descendants' rights to a lawyer-cousin named Durfey, whose descendants, the Durfey-Transomes (the Transomes of the story), are the rightful holders of the estate as long as there exists a male descendant of Thomas Transome. In the absence of such male descendant the right to the estate would pass to the Bycliffes. The complicated legal plot of the story rests upon this Durfey-Transome-Bycliffe situation and the fact that Esther Lyon's claim (as the last Bycliffe) becomes valid on the death of old Tommy Trounsem, the last descendant of Thomas Transome. In order to be sure that she was right in her handling of a plot based upon a question of law, George Eliot consulted Frederic Harrison, who suggested the legal scheme of the story and wrote the lawyer's \"opinion on the case\", which was incorporated in the novel. Frederic Harrison said later: \"I remember telling her, when she inserted these lines in the book, that I had written at least a sentence which was embodied in English literature.\" (See Harrison, Studies in Early Victorian Literature, p. 218; also his Memories and Thoughts, p. 137-140; also Cross, George Eliot's Life, vol. 2, p. 420, 423.)"

        "desc": "Felix Holt is a study in the Radicalism of the time of the Reform Bill, contrasting the ideal radicalism of Felix Holt, who, with talent which might command material success, prefers to spend himself in social service, and the political radicalism of the good business man, Harold Transome, who breaks away from the Tory traditions of his family because he sees that \" Radical sticks are growing while Tory oaks are rotting \". While Radicalism furnishes the theme of the story, the plot is woven around an intricate point of inheritance, and involves two contrasted cases of concealed parentage, that of Esther Lyon, where the concealment bas been prompted by affection, and that of Harold Transome, where the secret has sprung from sin and the revelation brings further unhappiness. Contrasted with various types of worldliness is the unworldly, eccentric, lovable Rufus Lyon, one of the finest representation in fiction of English Dissent. Retrospective. \u2014The Transomes, of Transome Court, hold their estate in base fee. In 1729, John Justus Transome entailed his estate on his son Thomas and Thomas's heirs, with remainder to the Bycliffes. Thomae, a spendthrift, disposed of his and his descendants' rights to hie lawyer cousin Durfey, who became Durfey-Transome. On the extinction of Thomas's line, the property must pass from Durfey's descendants to the Bycliffes. By 1832 the only descendant of Thomas left is old Tommy Trounsem, the bill-sticker. The Transomes feel quite safe, however, as the Bycliffes are supposed to have died out in 1812 with Maurice Christian Bycliffe, who started suit for the estate that year, but died in prison, into which he had been thrown on a trumped-up charge. Bycliffe had, however, married secretly a young French girl, Annette Ledru, and, shortly after her husband's death, Annette and her baby were rescued from starvation by the Independent minister, Rufus Lyon, who married Annette and after her death brought up her child as hie own daughter, Esther. Esther Lyon is, therefore, a Bycliffe, though she is ignorant of her parentage and her step-father is ignorant of her legal rights. Lawsuits and mismanagement have made the Transomes poorer. As Mr. Transome is a weak-minded invalid, the estate has been managed by his handsome imperious wife. With no affection for her husband, Mrs. Transome had turned to the sharp lawyer, Jermyn, who first made love to her and then used his hold over her to fleece the estate. Avoided by her neighbours because of scandal, she had centered all her affection on her second son, Harold, who went East to make his fortune. The Story. At the beginning of the story, in 1832, Harold Transome returns to England to take his place as heir after the death of his elder brother. He treats his mother generously, but does not defer to her, and his announcement that he will stand for Parliament as a Radical shocks her and his Tory neighbours. His canvass soon brings him into contact with Felix Holt, a Radical with ideals of social service which will always keep him poor, who lives in Treby Magna where he follows the trade of a watchmaker, although his parents had planned to have him rise socially by becoming a physician. As a matter of principle, he makes his mother give up the profitable sale of some worthless medicines. She asks her minister, Rufus Lyon, to remonstrate with Felix, and Felix thus meets Mr. Lyon's beautiful and fastidious daughter, Esther, who has a natural taste for the refinements of life. While antagonized by Esther's standards, Felix is interested in her, and continues the acquaintance, though at first only to lecture her, and she, while offended by his disregard for appearances, is attracted and wants to justify herself in his eyes. Felix finds a lost pocket-book, which he leaves with Mr. Lyon to be restored to its owner. Mr. Lyon sees in this some articles which must have belonged to Bycliffe, Esther's real father. When Maurice Christian (really Henry Scaddon, once a fellow prisoner of Bycliffe's in France) claims the wallet and refuses to answer questions, Mr. Lyon, distressed and believing that Christian may be Esther's father, whom he supposed dead, consults Mr. Jermyn, telling him Esther's story. As Jermyn knows the Bycliffe claims he realizes Esther's importance, but keeps the knowledge to himself to use as a weapon against Harold Transome. He secures Christian's silence by threats, but the latter, though ignorant of the Bycliffe claims, begins to piece bits of information together, and when he sees Esther as Mr. Lyon's daughter he recognizes her likeness to Bycliffe, and guesses the truth and eventually puts together the whole story. Though he fears it may cost him her affection, Rufus Lyon tells Esther her true story, and finds that the revelation touches her and draws her closer to him. Meantime, Felix and Esther have been gradually falling in love, though Felix believes that the difference in their attitude towards life makes marriage impossible, and Esther, while her ambition to be a great lady is changing, is not quite ready to give up all for Felix. In his political work Felix had found that the Transome agents, unknown to Harold Transome, were using means which he thinks will lead to riot. When election day comes trouble starts at once and the Riot Act is read. Felix, realizing the danger of serious disturbance, joins the crowd with the idea of leading it away from trouble. He is partly successful, but accidentally kills a constable and is arrested. In the riot old Tommy Trounsem is trampled to death. Losing the election, Harold Transome takes up business matters, and, having already suspected Jermyn of dishonesty, starts suit against him. Jermyn appeals to Mrs. Transome to save him by telling Harold the truth about himself and their past relations. After she refuses, he tells Harold that there is a Bycliffe, known only to him, whose claim has matured now that Tommy Trounsem is dead, and threatens Harold with the loss of the estate unless he stops proceedings against him. While Harold is still undecided what course to take, Christian offers to sell him the same information. He honourably refuses to suppress evidence, but learns from Christian that Esther Lyon is the heir. With his mother he invites Esther to Transome Court to try to reach some amicable adjust ment, and ends by falling in love with her. Esther sees Mrs. Transome's unhappiness and her embittered life, and that, with the recognition of her love for Felix, who is now awaiting trial for manslaughter, makes her realize that the wealth and rank which once seemed so attractive do not bring happiness. At the trial Esther volunteers testimony in his behalf, but he is sentenced to imprisonment. At a meeting organized to petition for his pardon, Jermyn, who has just learned that Harold has resumed proceedings against him, threatens Harold, and at last tells him publicly that he is his father. Harold offers to relinquish the whole estate to Esther, but as the trial has shown her that she loves Felix, she resigns her claims and returns to her father. Felix is pardoned and he and Esther are married. Additional information: 1st edition, Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons, 1866. 3 vols.

Worldly success measured in terms of income and social prestige is the only ambition which she can understand; she demands to be kept in luxury, refuses to yield to any of Lydgate's wishes, and to all of his attempts to explain to her his needs and his professional aims she opposes a gentle, inflexible obstinacy before which he is helpless. In the end he has to sacrifice his high ideals and scientific ambition and move to London in order to make the money necessary to give her the social position she craves.

About his ordinary bearing there was a certain fling, a fearless expectation of success, aconfidence in his own powers and integrity, much fortified by contempt for petty obstacles or seductions of which he had had no experience. But this proud openness was made lovable by an expression of unaffected good will.\" \"His scientific interest soon took the form of a professional enthusiasm; he had a youthful belief in his bread-winning work . . . and he carried to his studies . . . the conviction that the medical profession as it might be was the finest in the world . . . But he did not simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common. He was ambitious of a wider effect : he was fired with the possibility that he might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link in the chain of discovery . . . Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific, rational basis of his profession.\" He settles in Middlemarch, intending not only to be a good doctor, but also to carry on scientific investigation, for which he is well fitted. Captivated by Rosamond Vincy's beauty and grace, he marries her and soon discovers that she is absolutely selfish and unresponsive to his tender love, with no sympathy for his high aims. His opposition to accepted medical usages makes him unpopular with the other physicians of Middlemarch, and his connexion with Mr. Bulstrode leads him into trouble. His wife has only blame for him, and all his endeavours to economize are stubbornly opposed by her. The struggle between him and Rosamond, who demands position and luxury at any price, ends in the subjection of his higher self, and his noblest aims are sacrificed to worldly success. To meet the demands of her ambition he is forced to move to London, and become a fashionable physician, and dies there at a comparatively early age. The high-minded, medical side of Lydgate is said to have been drawn from the Rt. Hon. Sir T. Clifford Allbutt, Regius Professor of Physic, Cambridge, who, when Middlemarch was written, was head of the Leeds Fever Hospital which George Eliot visited. The portraiture is but partial and the circumstances different. (Manuscript notes.) George Eliot's friend and biographer, Mr. Oscar Browning, has also been suggested as the prototype, in part.

The first impression on seeing Will was one of sunny brightness, which added to the uncertainty of his changing expression. Surely, his very features changed their form; his jaw looked sometimes large and sometimes small; and the little ripple in his nose was a preparation for metamorphosis. When he turned his head quickly his hair seemed to shake out light, and some persons thought they saw decided genius in this coruscation.\" His grandmother, Mr. Casaubon's aunt, had been disinherited because she made a mesalliance, by marrying a poor Pole, and Mr. Casaubon, who feels an inherited responsibility for this, had educated Will. With artistic tastes, some ability as a writer, and a disregard for worldly considerations he has some difficulty in choosing a profession. When he meets Dorothea as Mr. Casaubon's wife he first becomes interested in her, and then grows to love her with constancy and devotion, and for the sake of being near her settles in Middlemarch as editor of Mr. Brooke's paper. His sense of honour causes him to refuse Mr. Bulstrode's offer of money, dishonestly gained, which should have been his mother's. When Dorothea, after a short widowhood, gives up position and fortune to marry him, he enters public life, without promise of marked success. It has been suggested that some traits in the character of Will Ladislaw were drawn, perhaps unconsciously, from George Henry Lewes, who, also, was a man of versatile talent and lively manner. Some critics, however, do not recognize Lewes as the original. Those who consider Lewes as the prototype find one of their arguments in the author's very evident fondness for the character of Ladislaw.

In fact, he had a reverential soul with a strong, practical intelligence. But he could not manage finance: he knew values well, but he had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape of profit and loss: and having ascertained this to his cost, he determined to give up all forms of his beloved 'business' which required that talent.

His experience was of that pitiable kind which shrinks from pity, and fears most of all that it should be\nknown; it was that proud, narrow sensitiveness which has not mass enough to spare for transformation into sympathy, and quivers thread-like in small currents of self-preoccupation or at best of an egoistic scrupulosity. And Mr. Casaubon had many scruples; he was capable of severe self-restraint; resolute he was in being a man of honour according to the code; he would be unimpeachable by any recognized opinion . . . the difficulty of making his Key to all Mythologies unimpeachable weighed like lead upon his mind . . . even his religious faith wavered with his wavering trust in his own authorship, and the consolations of the Christian hope in immortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the still unwritten Key to all Mythologies.\" He marries Dorothea Brooke, who has idealized him, and soon proves himself selfishly blind to her claims, and incapable of responding to her devotion. His ambition is centred in his projected masterpiece, \"Key to all Mythologies,\" but he lacks the ability necessary to carry it to completion. Because Dorothea manifests a friendly interest in his young kinsman, Will Ladislaw, he becomes unreasonably jealous, and when he dies some two years after his marriage, he leaves a codicil to his will depriving Dorothea of his property in case she marries Ladislaw. It has been claimed by some that the Reverend Mark pattison, Rector of Lincoln, was the original of Mr. Casaubon, while others have indignantly denied this. Mark Pattison was a visitor at George Eliot's home, and it is possible that she may, unconsciously, have copied some of his superficial characteristics. This, together with the name--Mark Pattison's best known work was his life of Isaac Casaubon--may have given rise to the report that he was the original.

Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Vergin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain garments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible--or from one of our elder poets--in a paragraph of today's newspaper. She was usually spoken of as being remakably clever, but with the addition that sister Celia had more common-sense.\" \"She came into the drawing room in her silver-grey dress--the simple lines of her dark brown hair parted over her brown and coiled massively behind, in keeping with the entire absence from her manner and expression of all searc after mere effect. Sometimes when Dorothea was in the company there seemed to be as complete an air of repose about her as if she had been a picture of Santa Barbara.\" \"The intensity of her religious disposition, the coercion it exercised over her life was but one aspect of a nature altogether ardent, theoretic and intellectually consequent; and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow teaching, hemmed in by social life which seemed nothing but a labyrinth of petty courses, a walled-in maze of small paths that led no whither, the outcome was sure to strike others as at once exaggeration and inconsistency.\" Dorothea at nineteen marries the middle-aged and pedantic Mr. Casaubon because she is in love with the idea of being a helpmate to him in his great work. She soon realizes that she has idealized her husband, who is a cold, jealous, and selfish man, engaged in a work of no real value. Although the shock of the disilluison is great and her intense nature at times rebels, she loyally devotes herself to Mr. Casaubon while he lives. She is on the point of sacrificing her future happiness by making him a promise, which, though she does not know its nature, would have separated her from Will Ladislaw, his young cousin, when Mr. Casaubon dies. Eventually she gives up her social position and Mr. Casaubon's money in order to marry Will Ladislaw. Dorothea's religious side was drawn, recognizably, from letters to George Eliot from Emilia Strong, who became first Mrs. mark Pattison and later Lady Dilke. There are points in her character--her opinions and her relation to her sister--which were suggested by things in George Eliot's own life."

The younger had always worna yoke; but is there any yoked creature without its private opinions?\" \"But on safe opportunities she had an indirect mode of making her negative wisdom tell upon Dorothea, and calling her down from her rhapsodic mood by reminding her that people were staring, not listening. Celia was not impulsive; what she had to say could wait, and came from her always with the same quite staccato evenness.\" Her sense of propriety is often shocked by Dorothea's unconventional views and deeds, and she occasionally has courage to utter her criticisms. She dislikes Mr. Casaubon, to whose blinking and moles she strongly objects. After Dorothea marries Mr. Casaubon, Celia makes a very happy marriage with the correct Sir James Chettam, and feels an affectionate superiority to her sister, as one who has managed her life less well. her real affection for Dorothea does not allow her to be parted from her, even when she greatly disapproves of her second marriage. The original of Celia Brooke was George Eliot's elder sister, Christiana Evans, later Mrs. Edward Clarke, although the character of Celia is not an exact portrait of her sister."

Later, when he plunges into politics and wishes to run for Parliament, he engages the services of Will Ladislaw and retains him in the neighbourhood to the displeasure of jealous Mr. Casaubon. When Dorothea, then a young widow, marries Will Ladislaw, he is unable to manifest any serious displeasure and, although he at first talks of cutting the entail, her eldest son eventually inherits his estates.

        "desc": "Middlemarch tells two separate stories, that of Dorothea Brooke and her two marriages, and that of Dr. Lydgate and the Vincy family, loosely knit together by the fact that they are acted on the same stage and before the same detailed background of middle-class life in and near an English provincial town. It was originally begun as two separate novels, Miss Brooke, Dorothea's story, and Middlemarch, which was to picture the Lydgate-Vincy-Garth scenes, but the two, when partly finished, were combined under the second title. The main theme, failure through pressure of circumstances to realize an ideal aim, is the same in both stories, though its development is different. Dorothea, with the ideals and aspirations of a modem Saint Theresa, blocks the channels of her aspiration by a marriage of which her friends cannot approve, and Lydgate, fired by ambition for the highest service in his profession, is dragged from his ideal by the fact that he has tied himself to a selfish wife. There is a minor story in the love affairs of Fred Vincy and Mary Garth, and the picture of medical men and medical practice in the early nineteenth century is keen and true social satire. Dorothea Brooke and her younger sister, Celia, are orphans who live with their bachelor uncle at his estate of Tipton Grange, near Middlemarch. Young and ardent, with ideas of self-sacrifice, Dorothea longs for some great vocation in which she can spend herself. She is being courted by Sir James Chettam, a young baronet whose estate adjoins her uncle's, but when she meets the Rev. Mr. Casaubon, a narrow, elderly pedant engaged in an endless work of arid research, she thinks him a great soul and marries him, believing that devotion to bis work will realize her ideal of service. They go to Rome on their wedding trip, and there Dorothea sees something of her husband's cousin, Will Ladislaw, a mercurial young man with artistic tastes and no fortune, who is attracted to Dorothea. After her return to England Dorothea soon realizes the futility of her husband's great work, and, though she loyally adapts herself to him, she unconsciously irritates him by seeming to espouse the cause of Will Ladislaw, whom Mr. Casaubon dislikes, although he has educated him out of a sense of responsibility, as Ladislaw's grandmother (Casaubon's aunt) had been disinherited. Mr. Casaubon's estate is near Middlemarch, and there Dorothea meets again Dr. Lydgate, a promising young physician, with ideas about medical reform. Mr. Casaubon has a heart attack and Lydgate, called in to attend him, tells him and Dorothea that the disease may end fatally at any time. About eighteen months after their marriage, Mr. Casaubon, a disappointed man, dies before obtaining from Dorothea a promise that in the event of his death she will carry out his wishes. His will leaves his property to Dorothea, but with the insulting provision that she shall forfeit it all if she marries Ladislaw. Sir James Chettam, now Dorothea's brother-in-law, as he has married Celia, would like to have Ladislaw discreetly removed from the neighbourhood, but he remains to help Mr. Brooke, who is standing for Parliament and has found Ladislaw useful as his factotum. Dr. Lydgate, in whose work Dorothea had become interested through her husband's illness, is a promising young physician of skill and education but no fortune, who, since he came to Middlemarch some two years before, has been building up a practice and has received from Mr. Bulstrode, a rich man who is trying by philanthropy to ease his conscience about past sharp practices, the appointment as physician to the New Hospital. Lydgate's modem ideas have ma.de enemies among the old school physicians and their supporters. When Lydgate meets Rosamond Vincy, the Mayor's beautiful daughter, he finds her so attractive that he is blind to her selfishness. Rosamond, ambitious to rise socially, and impressed by the fact that Lydgate is nephew to a baronet, decides to marry him and they are married before Lydgate has established himself sufficiently to meet the expense of the style of living that Rosamond considers necessary. The Vincys are connected by marriage with old Peter Featherstone, the miser, as are also the Garths. Fred Vincy, Rosamond's brother, and Mary Garth, the sensible, good-humoured daughter of Caleb Garth, builder and agent, have been in love since childhood. When Peter Featherstone dies without providing for him, Fred, to please Mary, gives up the idea of entering the Church, for which he is not fitted, and Caleb takes him into his business. Eventually Fred and Mary are married and he becomes a successful and respected farmer. In the meantime, as Rosamond will not adapt herself in any way, the Lydgates have lived beyond their means, and Dr. Lydgate, in serious money difficulties, is hampered by the unsympathetic attitude and stubborn opposition of his wife. When Mr. Bulstrode, his patron at the New Hospital, becomes involved in scandal caused by dishonourable acts in his past, Lydgate is unjustly involved in his disgrace because some financial aid which he has had from Bulstrode at an unfortunate time is wrongly interpreted as a bribe. Almost the only one who stands by him and believes in his integrity is Dorothea Casaubon. Since her husband's death Dorothea has not been happy. She has not been able to find any service which satisfies her idea of self-devotion, and she is increasingly conscious of her love for Ladislaw, although she feels that circumstances have made it impossible for them ever to come together. h her efforts to find ways of spending herself she has given generously to Lydgate's hospital. When she learns that he intends to solve his difficulties by leaving Middlemarch and the work which represents the higher part of himself, she lends him the money to pay Bulstrode, and visits Rosamond to try to persuade her to stand by her husband. At Rosamond's she finds Will Ladislaw, and believing that he is flirting with Rosamond, suffers greatly from the thought, until Rosamond later, touched by Dorothea's generous friendliness, explains the mistake. Realizing her love for Ladislaw, and seeing to satisfaction except in devotion to him, Dorothea decides to marry him and relinquish her property. In this marriage, although for a time it separates her from her family, Dorothea finds the kind of happiness which her nature demands. Lydgate is less fortunate, as Rosamond never sympathizes with his ideals. To meet her demands he has to give up his idea of scientific distinction, and cultivate rich patients, and he dies comparatively young, feeling that his life has been a failure.

The men who held the ropes were French soldiers, and by broken Italian phrases and strokes from the knotted end of the rope, they from time to time stimulated their prisoners to beg.\" The three prisoners were real, and an account of their release by the populace and their escape through the city is given in Villari's Savonarola. The only fictitious things in George Eliot's account are her making Baldassarre Calvo one of the prisoners and his subsequent encounter with Tito Melema."

If he were silent when his father expected some response, still he did not look moody; if he declined some labour--why he flung himself down with such a charming, half-smiling, halfpleading air, that the pleasure of looking at him made amends . . . the curves of Tito's mouth had ineffable good humour in them. And then, the quick talent to which everything came readily, from philosophical systems to the rhymes of a street ballad caught up at a hearing!\" \"[He] made almost every one fond of him, for he was young, and clever, and beautiful, and his manners to all were gentle and kind. I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of anything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as his own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds-such as make men infamous. He denied his father, and left him to misery; he betrayed every trust that was reposed in him, that he might keep himself safe and get rich and prosperous.\" He owes everything to his foster-father, Baldassarre CaJvo, who had brought him up as his own son. On a trip to Delos their boat was attacked by pirat.es and Baldassarre was captured, while Tito, who was carrying all their fortune in gems, escaped by swimming. In Florence, to which he makes his way after this misfortune, his brightness and charm\nat once win him friends-Tessa, the contadina, shares her breakfast with him, and Nello, the barber, takes him under his protection and introduces him to the blind scholar, Bardo de' Bardi, through whose aid he succeeds in selling his gems and obtaining a post as professor of Greek. He acts as secretary to Bardo, winning both the confidence of the old scholar and the love of Bardo's beautiful daughter, Romola. Tito has allowed himself to keep up an acquaintance with Tessa, and eventually as a jest goes through a mock marriage with her. After selling his gems for a large sum he had made no attempt to use the money to find his father, persuading himself, instead, that the old man must be dead, and he even rejects a direct appeal for aid which the monk, Fra Luca, brings him from his father. His marriage to Romola is at first happy, but many things, especially his bad faith in selling her father's library, soon make her see that he is faithless and conscienceless, and they drift apart. When Baldassarre Calvo, as an escaped prisoner, comes upon Tito in Florence, Tito denies him and later even carries his treachery so far as to have Baldassarre imprisoned for two years. His tact and versatility have made him useful t.o many people, and he serves all three political parties at the same time, without any real loyalty to any, considering nothing but his own interest, working against Savonarola while pretending to be of his party, and even consenting to the death of Romola's godfather. He over-reaches himself, however, by arousing the resentment of Dolfo Spini whom he serves for his own ends, is attacked by Spini's followers, the Compagnacci, and, just as he succeeds in escaping from them, is found and killed by his deserted old father, the most sinned against of the many whom his selfishness has injured."

On his way home, broken in health, he meets aman who has seen Baldassarre Calvo, Tito Melema's deserted father, and from him receives a letter to Tito begging him to save his father from slavery. He delivers the note, and is thus the one person who knows that Tito is aware that his father is alive. Although he has this knowledge, which might have saved his sister Romola from her disastrous marriage to Tito Melema, he does not warn her of it, but instead, when dying, gives her a visionary, mystical warning which merely distresses her.

His beard which had grown long in neglect, and the hair which fell thick and straight round his baldness, were nearly white. His thickset figure was still firm and upright, though emaciated, and seemed to express energy in spite of age--and exptression that was partly carried out in the dark eyes and strong dark eyebrows, which had a strangely isolated intensity of colour in the midst of his yellow, bloodless, deep-wrinkled face with its lank grey hairs. And yet there was something fitful in the eyes, which contradicted the occasional flash of energy; after looking round with quick fierceness at windows and faces, they fell again with a lost and wandering look.\" A great scholar and of ample means, he had adopted Tito Melema as a child and had brough him up as his own son. While journeying to Delos he is captured by pirates, though Tito, who carries their fortune in gems, escapes. Carried into captivity, he believes that his son will find and ransom him, and succeeds in sending Tito word of his whereabouts. After desertion and illness have broken him down, he is sent back to Italy, and, as a prisoner of the French, is brought to Florence, where Tito has been prospering since their separation. Near the Duomo he escapes from his guards and runs into Tito, who knows him, but denies him. Brooding over this treachery, he attempts to kill Tito when they meet again, and later, when his mental powers have returned temporarily, makes charges against Tito at the great supper in the Rucellai Gardens, but is again denied by Tito and again breaks down, and is cast into prison, where he languishes for two years, until released during the famine. Romola succours him and he seeks to enlist her aid against Tito, by telling her of Tito's \"other wife\", Tessa. Reduced to a pitiable condition by mental and physical suffering and forced to beg, he is kept alive only by the hope of vengeance. Eventually he finds Tito again, when the latter, worn out by his long swim to escape the mob, is cast ashore on the river bank, and he strangles Tito, dying himself immediately after. While Baldassarre Calvo is a fictitious character, there is an historical original for one of the events of his career. Villari, in his Life of Savonarola, tells of the escape of three prisoners at the time of the French entry into Florence who were liberated by the crowd just as in Romola. As this is the only printed source for this story, George Eliot undoubtedly took this incident from Villari, as Guido Biagi points out. (See Villari, Savonarola, p. 231; also Biagi edition of Romola. Introd. p. xxxiv.)"

She has led secluded life, devoted entirely to her blind father, whose secretary she is. She falls in love with Tito Melema almost at first sight, gives him her entire\ntrust as well as her love, and marries him, believing that he has the same high ideals as herself. Aside from her love for Tito, her devotion to her father is the strongest feeling in her life, and after his death she feels it a sacred obligation to carry out his wish to have his library preserved for the city of Florence. Although several things disturb her confidence in Tito, her eyes are not opened to his real character until he sells her father's library to the Duke of Milan in violation of what she considers a sacred trust. Believing that this shattering of her love releases her from her marriage vows, she decides to leave her husband, and is leaving Florence in disguise when she is stopped by Savonarola, who tells her that she can not thus break a sacred bond, and exhorts her to return and take up work for others if her personal happiness is gone. She yields to his influence, becomes one of his devoted followers, even though she does not accept all of his religious beliefs, and for several years spends herself in good works, staying with Tito, although their real separation in character and ideals becomes constantly more evident as Tito drifts from one treachery to another. When her godfather, Bernardo del Nero, is arrested, as she fears through Tito's treachery, and is executed in spite of her efforts to persuade Savonarola to save him, the limit of her endurance is  reached. Disappointed in Savonarola and grief-stricken at her godfather's death, she flees from Florence. By chance she reaches a plague-stricken village, and wins back peace and spiritual health by working among the sufferers. She returns to Florence just after Tito's death, and finds and cares for his two natural children and their mother. She is present at Savonarola's execution, and both then and during the rest of her life reveres him as a great religious leader who had helped her at a critical moment of her life. Romola, though nominally an Italian of the Renaissance, is so essentially an English Puritan that the suggestion has been made that some things in her character represent experiences of George Eliot's spiritual life. There is probably no ground for tracing a general resemblance, but in one respect, Romola's devotion to her father, there is, perhaps, a suggestion of a picture of George Eliot's affection for her father."

At the San Giovanni festa, Tito rescues her from annoyance, and later, at the Fierucola, goes through a mock marriage ceremony with her, which, as he is really in love with Romola, means nothing to him. After his marriage to Romola, finding that Tessa has taken the mock ceremony seriously, Tito establishes her in a house of his own, and two children, Lillo and Ninna, are born. Tito is really fond of the children, and, gradually, as he loses Romola's affection, he finds relief in Tessa's stupidity and her unquestioning devotion. When he plans to leave Florence he arranges to take Tessa and the children with him, but his death leaves Tessa stranded and in despair, until she is found by Romola, who looks after her and the children."

In the act of bending, the cowl was pushed back, and the features of the monk had the full light of the tapers on them. They were very marked features, such as lend themselves to popular description. There was the high arched nose, the prominent under lip, the coronet of thick dark hair above the brow, all seeming to tell of energy and passion; there were the blue-grey eyes, shining mildly under auburn eyelashes, seeming, like the hands, to tell of acute sensitiveness.\" \"There was nothing transcendent in Savonarola's face. It was not beautiful. It was strongfeatured, and owed all its refinement to habits of mind and rigid discipline of the body.\" \"Fra Girolamo's mind never stopped short of that sublimest end: the objects towards which he felt himself working had always the same moral magnificence. He had no private malice\u2014he sought no petty gratification. Even in the last terrible days, when ignominy, torture, and the fear of torture, had laid bare every hidden weakness of his soul, he could say to his importunate judges: 'Do not wonder if it seems to you that I have told but few things; for my purposes were few and great.' \"Savonarola, the great religious and political reformer of Florence, is the central figure in the historical part of Romola, and also, through the influence which he exerts over Romola herself, an important figure in the fictitious part of the plot. Romola first sees him at her brother's death-bed, but his principal connexion with her is when he meets her, on her attempted flight from her husband, and influences her by his exhortations to return to Tito and take up work for others though her personal happiness is gone. The main events in his career which figure in the novel are his preaching in the Duomo and elsewhere, his purification of the popular life of Florence, and his Bonfire of Vanities, the challenge which he receives from Fra Francesco and the attempted Trial by Fire, his last sermon and his arrest and execution. Girolamo Savonarola, the great Florentine reformer, was born at Ferrara in 1452; he came to Florence in 1489, was excommunicated 1497, and arrested and executed 1498. George Eliot's picture of Savonarola's career and influence in Florence follows closely the account in the standard biography, that of Pasquale Villari, and is both historically accurate and sympathetic. The importance of her portrait is attested by the fact that Romola is mentioned seriously in the preface to the revised edition of Villari, and is cited frequently in the later biography by Lucas."

        "desc": "Romola is the story of the spiritual history of a beautiful, high-minded young Florentine, married to a consummate egoist, who struggles to preserve the ideal of her love until forced to realize her husband's baseness, and then, under Savonarola's influence, reconstructs upon the wreck of her personal happiness a life of unselfish service to her community. Aside from the fictitious characters, Romola and Tito, the outstanding figure is Savonarola, whose triumph and downfall are interwoven in the plot, and many minor historical characters throng the scene. The tragedy of Romola's love and Tito's deterioration is played out before a rich historical background of the popular, literary, religious, and political life of Florence at the end of the fifteenth century. Tito Melema is the adopted son of Baldassarre Calvo, a rich scholar, who had brought Tito up with all the love and care that he would have given his own child. On a voyage to Delos they were shipwrecked and Baldassarre was captured by pirates, while Tito, carrying their fortune in gems, saved himself by swimming. As a shipwrecked stranger, he makes his way to Florence to seek his fortune. In the Mercato Vecchio his charm wins a breakfast for love from Tessa, the pretty contadina, and Nello, the barber, who knows everyone in Florence, takes him under his protection. Nello introduces him to the eruditi who patronize his shop, and later presents him to the blind scholar, Bardo de' Bardi, and Bardo's beautiful daughter, Romola. His charm and gentleness win both, and he is soon installed as Bardo's helper. His talents and tact quickly win him a recognized position, he sells his father's gems and has money enough to begin a search for his father. Arguing, however, that as he does not know definitely that his father is alive, he is not bound to search for him, he puts the money aside for his own use. After a few months, at the time of the San Giovanni celebration, a monk brings him a letter from his father telling that he has been sold into slavery and begging him to use his gems to ransom him. Although he has no idea of sacrificing himself to seek his father, he is alarmed at the thought that the news may become known, especially when he learns that the returned monk is Romola's brother. The monk falls ill, and Tito, relieved for a time, temporizes, and he and Romola become engaged. At the Peasants' Fair, Tito meets Tessa again, and goes through a mock marriage ceremony, which she takes seriously. Romola's brother dies without revealing his knowledge that Baldassarre Calvo is alive, and Tito and Romola are married. Tito prospers steadily, and when, in 1494, the French king, Charles VIII, enters Florence, he is one of those prominent in his reception. Some prisoners of the French escape, and one of them clutches Tito in his flight. Terrified, Tito recognizes his injured father, but refuses to acknowledge him, and the old man disappears. Though his sufferings have affected his mind, he recognizes Tito and concentrates all his remaining powers on the thought of vengeance. In spite of the fact that he is in love with Romola only, Tito has kept up relations with Tessa. Visiting her one evening, he finds that she has given shelter to his father. Baldassarre tries to stab Tito, but the chain armour that he is wearing protects him. Shortly before this Romola's father had died, leaving to Romola the task of seeing that his treasured library, which he had spent a lifetime in collecting, is preserved for the people of Florence. This library, which Romola regards as a sacred trust, Tito sells in order to raise money. Romola, whose eyes have now been opened to her husband's baseness, decides to leave him, and starts for Bologna, but is turned back by Savonarola, the great Dominican preacher, whose sermons are stirring Florence. He appeals to her to rise above the wreck of her own happiness and to return to Florence to work for the community. Romola becomes one of Savonarola's devoted adherents, and for two years spends herself in work for his ideals. During that time Tito prospers steadily. He is in the confidence of both parties, Savonarola's and the Medicean. Baldassarre's mind returns temporarily, and he makes a public charge against Tito, but on Tito's denial the old man is thrown into prison and kept there for two years. Much enfeebled, he still holds to his idea of vengeance, but all that he accomplishes is to tell Romola of the existence of Tessa and her children. Tito slips from treachery to treachery. When a Medicean plot is discovered, in 1497, one of those arrested is Bernardo del Nero, Romola's godfather, to whom she is much attached. Tito cleverly makes himself safe, but Bernardo is condemned and executed after Romola has made an urgent but vain appeal in bis behalf to Savonarola, now at the height of bis power. Bick at heart, Romola leaves Florence and recovers her hold on life only after she has worked as an angel of mercy in a plague-stricken village. During her absence Savonarola is arrested, and riot rages in the city. Some of Tito's double-dealing is at last suspected, and he is pursued by a mob as he is about to leave the city. He leaps into the Amo and escapes the mob by swimming, but at the end, exhausted, is found by Baldassarre Calvo, who strangles him and then dies himself. Romola, returning to Florence, learns of her husband's death, and is present at the execution of Savonarola. She finds Tessa and her children deserted and in misery, and takes them to live with her. Years after she still keeps sacred the memory of Savonarola who had helped her at the great crisis of her life.

His gold, as he hung over it and saw it grow, gathered his power of loving together into a hard isolation like its own.\" In his youth he had been an artisan in a large manufacturing town where, in spite of the fact that he was subject to occasional cataleptic attacks, he led a contented life, his strong interests being his membership in a dissenting church, his friendship for William Dane, and his approaching marriage. Falsely accused of a robbery through his friend's treachery, and driven from church and home, he had wandered to Raveloe where he settled. With all faith in both men and religion lost through his cruel experience, he leads there a lonely life as a recluse and miser, his one pleasure the contemplation of the growing hoard of gold which he saves slowly by hard and constant toil. When his money is stolen, and the little golden-haired Eppie, an unclaimed child, comes, as he thinks, in place of the gold, he brings her up as his daughter, and through her needs and affection regains his joy in life. Note.\u2014The plot of Silas Marner shows some marked resemblance to a Polish story by Kraszewski called Jermola the Potter. The similarity is most striking in the case of the central figure, Jermola, a deserted lonely old man left in poverty by the well-to-do family to which he had given a lifetime of service. Like Silas Marner, old Jermola finds a deserted infant near his hut, adopts it, and through love for it and the efforts which he has to make to support it, is restored to a happy and useful life. Unlike Silas, however, his life ends in tragedy, as the child is taken from him. (See also note under Silas Marner in Synopses.)"

        "desc": "Silas Marner, \"a story of old-fashioned village life,\" was the last of George Eliot's novels which owed much to the influences of her childhood and girlhood in Warwickshire. She herself best describes its theme in a letter to her publisher, William Blackwood, in which she says that the story \"is intended to set in a strong light the remedial influences of pure, natural, human relations\". The principal agency through which these remedial influences were to work is expressed in the quotation from Wordsworth given on the title page of the first edition: \"A child more than all other gifts That earth can offer to declining man, Brings hope with it and forward-looking thoughts.\" The same letter to William Blackwood says that the story \"came to me first of all quite suddenly as a legendary tale suggested by my recollection of having once in early childhood seen a linen weaver with a bag on his back\". Silas Marner, a handloom weaver, is living a lonely life in Raveloe. Fifteen years before, when he was an ardent, devoted member of an Independent church in Lantern Yard, in a northern manufacturing town, he had been unjustly accused of theft by his best friend, the real thief, had been tried according to the casting of lots, found guilty, and cast off both by his church and by his sweetheart. With all faith in both God and man utterly shattered, he had wandered to Raveloe, where he had settled near some deserted stone pits. Though awed by his cataleptic attacks, the villagers would have taken him into their life, but his numbed mind and soul were incapable of responding. His one emotion is love of the gold in which his unremitting toil is paid, and his one pleasure is handling this gold aft.er his work is done. One stormy November evening when he returns to his cottage he finds that hie gold has been stolen. In trembling despair he rushes with the news of his loss to the circle of village worthies at the Rainbow Inn. The theft, which remains unexplained, has been committed by Dunstan, or Dunsey, Case, the worthless second son of the village Squire. Godfrey Case, the Squire's eldest son, is in love with good and pretty Nancy Lammeter, but two years before he had married secretly a barmaid in a neighbouring town. Godfrey's secret, and the fact that he has a child, are known to Dunsey, who uses hie hold over Godfrey to extort money from him. Dunsey, knowing of Silas's rumoured hoard, enters Silas's cottage, steals the gold, and disappears entirely. On New Year's Eve, Godfrey's wife is on her way to Raveloe to reveal her marriage to Godfrey's father. She yields to her addiction to opium, and, overcome by the drug, dies in the snow near Silas Marner's cottage, while her little golden-haired child slips from her arms and crawls into the cottage, unseen by Silas, who has fallen into one of his cataleptic fits. When he comes to he sees only the gleam of golden hair, and thinks for a moment that his gold has come back. Godfrey, desiring to marry Nancy, refrains from identifying the woman or claiming the child from Silas. The child touches Silas's heart, and he, feeling vaguely that she has been sent to him instead of the lost treasure, clings to her in spite of his neighbours\u2019 protests, adopts her, and with the help of good Dolly Winthrop brings her up, calling her Eppie. The task of caring for her, the relations with his neighbours which the child's needs bring about, and the child's love gradually restore Silas to the normal cheerful creature that he had been before hie misfortune at Lantern Yard. Godfrey has married Nancy, but, in spite of their love, is not entirely happy, as he has no children, and he has a guilty feeling because he has not acknowledged Eppie. Silas's money has never been found, but he, happy in the new life with Eppie, has ceased to regret it. After sixteen years, the draining of the stone pits reveals Dunstan's skeleton and the lost money. Stirred by this discovery, Godfrey tells Nancy that Eppie is his daughter, and Nancy agrees to welcome her. She and Godfrey tell Eppie and Silas the truth, expecting Eppie to turn to them. Eppie, however, refuses to leave Silas, whom she regards as her real father, and Godfrey realizes that he cannot escape the penalties of his early deceit. With his restored money Silas takes Eppie to visit Lantern Yard, but can find no trace of his former life. Eppie marries Aaron Winthrop, her old playmate, and with Silas continues to live the humble life of a villager. Note. Jermola the Potter, a novel by the Polish writer, Kraszewski, has a theme so like that of Silas Marner that it has been frequently pointed out as the source of the central idea of George Eliot's story. Up to a certain point the resemblance is striking. Jermola, an old family servant, is tamed adrift after a lifetime of devoted service, with no provision for his old age. He is sinking into a state of isolation and misery when he rescues a deserted infant left near his cottage. He keeps the boy, and their mutual affection and the child's needs restore him to normal activity and happiness. At the age of twelve the boy is claimed by his real parents, but refuses to desert hie foster-father. He is taken from the old man, pines in his new home, and escapes to return to Jermola. Eventually the child dies from an illness contracted while the two are fleeing to a place of safety, and the old man sinks into misery and idiocy. Richard Garnett points out, in his edition of Silas Marner, that while the resemblance is too close to be merely accidental, it is difficult to account for it, as the Polish story, though published ten years before Silas Marner, was not translated until several years after the publication of that story. The resemblance, while interesting, is not important, as George Eliot's genius has made a totally different story from the same theme.

There are many things in it which I would willingly say over again, and I shall never put them in any other form.\" Latimer, a frail, sensitive lad, is neglected at home because his father prefers his healthy elder brother, Alfred. At sixteen he is sent to study at Geneva, where he forms a warm friendship for Charles Meunier and passes the happiest years of his life. After a severe illness he finds that he has acquired a strange power of clairvoyance, which enables him, at times, to see distant scenes and events and to read the thoughts of others. When he meets Bertha Grant, a beautiful, cold girl, who is betrothed to Alfred, he is fascinated by her, and his new gift tells him that she is heartless and that he is destined to marry her. At first, however, she is the only one whose thoughts he cannot read. Alfred's death in a hunting accident makes Latimer the heir and he marries Bertha. The marriage is unhappy, as Bertha is dissatisfied because it does not give her all the social success she craves, and Latimer, when his wife's cruel heart and barren mind are eventually open to his insight, finds only misery in the union. At the end of seven years Charles Meunier, now a distinguished physician, visits Latimer. Bertha's maid, Archer, is taken ill and Bertha watches over her anxiously as though afraid to leave her. When Archer is apparently dead an experiment of Dr. Meunier's revives her for a few momenta, and she reveals the fact that Bertha means to poison Latimer. Bertha and Latimer separate, and he eventually secludes himself in the country to await the death which his unhappy insight tells him will occur from heart disease on 20th September, 1850.

She leads a life of ups and downs, happy with her brother and her books or miserable in her attic to which she flies for refuge. After her father fails she is inspired by her reading of Thomas a Kempis to lead a life of self-renunciation and repression. In the Red Deeps she renews her friendship with Philip Wakem, the cripple, who had been at school with Tom. When he declares his love for her she mistakes affection for him for love. After some time her brother Tom discovers that she and Philip are meeting and brutally forces Maggie to renounce Philip. When, at nineteen, she has developed into a beauty with wonderful dark eyes, she meets her cousin Lucy's lover, Stephen Guest, and he falls in love with her. In spite of the fact that she is still fond of Philip she ends by returning Stephen's love, although struggling against it. While boating on the Floss they are accidentally carried too far by the tide, and Maggie at first thinks that she will yield to Stephen's desire to continue the journey and be married, but her better nature triumphs, and she leaves him to return courageously to her family. Her brother refuses to forgive her and disowns her. They are united only when they lose their lives together in the flood, when Maggie attempts to rescue Tom. \"Brother and sister had gone down in an embrace never to be parted; living through again in one supreme moment the days when they had clasped their hands in love, and roamed the daisied fields together.\" The original of Maggie Tulliver, more particularly in childhood, was George Eliot herself, and the first part of the story is largely autobiographic. Mr. Cross says: \"No doubt the early part of Maggie's portraiture is the best autobiographical representation we can have of George Eliot's own feelings in her childhood, and many of the incidents in the book are based on real experiences of family life\u2014but . . . mixed with fictitious elements and situations.\" (See Cross, George Eliot's Life, vol. 1, p. 31; see also Stephen, George Eliot, p. 87.)"

But milk and mildness are not the best things for keeping.\" \"Mrs. Tulliver was a thorough Dodson, though a mild one, as small-beer, so long as it is any thing, is only describable as very weak ale; and though she had groaned alittle in her youth under the yoke of her elder sisters, and still shed occasional tears at their sisterly reproaches, it was not in Mrs. Tulliver to be an innovator on the family ideas. She was thankful to have been a Dodson, and to have one child who took after her own family.\" She bemoans the fact that Maggie is not a Dodson like her cousin, Lucy, and when Mr. Tulliver fails and she loses her cherished household gods her little world is upset, and she does not know how to readjust herself.

Law was a sort of cockfight, in which it was the business of injured honesty to get a game bird with the best pluck and the strongest spurs.\" He is devoted to Maggie, \"the little wench,\" and generous to his less fortunate sister, Mrs. Moss, but his hot temper leads him into numerous lawsuits and eventually he loses Dorlcote Mill and becomes bankrupt. In order to save money for his creditors he manages the mill for his enemy, Lawyer Wakem, who has purchased it. When his debts are paid he gives way to his temper and hate, violently assaults Mr. Wakem. and dies from the shock to his enfeebled system. It has been suggeeted that a certain Tom Hollick, a farmer and miller of Nuneaton, whose mill George Eliot used to pass on her way to school, may have been the original of Mr. Tulliver. Hollick was described by one who remembered him as a sanguine high-tempered man, impatient of any attempt to impose upon him, who was involved in a lawsuit. (Manuscript information; also article in Great Thoughts, March, 1901, p. 370.) Mr. Tulliver is not George Eliot's father, although the tender affection which Mr. Tulliver feels for Maggie may be drawn from the author's recollection of her own father."

So of her curled fronts: Mrs. Glegg had doubtless the glossiest and crispest brown curls in her drawers, as well as curls in various degrees of fuzzy laxness; but to look out on the week-day world from under a crisp and glossy front would be to introduce a most dreamlike and unpleasant confusion between the sacred and the secular.

When one of the family was in trouble or sickness, all the rest went to visit the unfortunate member, usually at the same time, and did not shrink from uttering the most disagreeable truths that correct family feeling dictated.\" \"A conspicuous quality in the Dodson character was its  genuineness: its vices and virtues alike were phases of a proud, honest egoism, which had a hearty dislike to whatever made against its own credit and interest, and would be frankly hard of speech to inconvenient 'kin', but would never forsake or ignore them \u2014would not let them want bread, but only require them to eat it with bitter herbs.\"  George Eliot's mother, Mrs. Robert Evans, was a Pearson, and it is admitted that her family, the Pearsons, were the originals of the Dodsons.

At spring tide the water rises on the surface of the river to a height of from seven to eight feet and rolls on in a large mass from the mouth of the Trent, considerably above the bridge. On account of the obstructions it meets with before it gets to Gainsburgh, the Eagre is some what diminished in size, but a few miles below the town it has a grand appearance.\" At the time of the fall\nequinox the Eagre is some times unusually high.

        "desc": "Mill on the Floss is an \u201cautobiographic novel\", recording much of the author's recollection of her own childhood and of the people and scenes of her Warwickshire days. According to her husband, John Walter Cross, \" the early part of Maggie's portraiture is the best representation we can have of George Eliot's own feelings in her childhood, and many of the incidents in the book are based on real experiences of family life, but so mixed with fictitious elements and situations that it would be absolutely misleading to trust to it as history.\" The title originally selected was Sister Maggie, but after the book was about one-third finished, this was changed, at the suggestion of William Blackwood, to Mill on the Floss. As children, Tom and Maggie Tulliver live happily in their home at Dorlcote Mill, the \"Mill on the Floss\", which has been in their father's family for five generations. Maggie, a passionate, undisciplined, impulsive, imaginative girl of nine, is devoted to her practical, unimaginative brother, who is three years older. Her fondness for Tom, her devotion to her father, whose favourite child she is, and her instinctive revolt against the standards of the overpoweringly respectable Dodsons, her mother's family\u2014especially Mrs. Glegg, the eldest Dodson aunt\u2014are the forces which mould Maggie's childhood. She is fond of her gentle cousin, Lucy Deane, a neat blond girl who is held up as a model Dodson, but once, in a fit of jealousy at Tom's preference for Lucy, Maggie runs away to join the Gypsies. After an unhappy experience with lawyers through his addiction to lawsuits, Mr. Tulliver determines to educate Tom to be a match for \"Old Harry and the raskills\", and places him with the Reverend Walter Stelling, who gives him an entirely unsuitable education. The only other pupil is Philip Wakem, a sensitive, deformed lad, the son of Lawyer Wakem, Mr. Tulliver's enemy. The boys never become real friends, but Philip develops a devoted friendship for Maggie. Mr. Tulliver involves himself in an expensive lawsuit with a neighbour, which is decided against him. The expense bankrupts him, and after an encounter with Wakem he has a stroke which nearly proves fatal. Tom is called back from school, and he and Maggie find the bailiffs in possession of the Mill. The well-to-do Dodsons lament the family disgrace, but give no practical help, and Tom, now sixteen years old, goes to work in a minor position with Guest & Co., his Uncle Deane's firm. To humiliate his fallen enemy, Mr. Wakem buys the Tulliver property and offers to keep Mr. Tulliver on as his employee at the Mill. Mr. Tulliver, recovering, accepts the humiliation, but makes Tom swear eternal enmity against the Wakems. For three years all live a drab, narrow existence. Mr. Tulliver and Tom are straining every nerve to save enough to pay the creditors in full and thus rehabilitate the family honour, and Maggie, with a passionate longing for a fuller life, finds her only safety in self-sacrifice. Philip Wakem renews their friendship, and he and Maggie meet in the Red Deeps. To Maggie, now in her seventeenth year, it has been merely a tender friendship which brightens her sad life, and when Philip tells her of his love, she does not realize that her affection is not love. The friendship had been concealed from her family, but Tom discovers it and forces Maggie to dismiss Philip. Tom, through Bob Jakin, the packman, learns how to trade on his own account, and with capital borrowed from Aunt Glegg makes enough to complete the sum needed to pay his father's creditors. After the formal payment, Mr. Tulliver, excited by his triumph, has an altercation with Wakem, and suffers another stroke, from which he dies. After her father's death Maggie teaches until, at nineteen, she visits her cousin Lucy Deane, the belle of St. Ogg's, a gentle, sweet-natured girl, who is being courted by the rich Stephen Guest. At Lucy's, Maggie, who has now developed from a plain child into a beautiful woman, tastes for the first time the social pleasures natural to girls of her age. Stephen Guest falls in love with her and she returns his feeling. In Lucy's circle is Philip Wakem, whose love for Maggie is unchanged, and Lucy, knowing the old affection between the two, is blind to Stephen's infatuation and thinks only of bringing Philip and Maggie together. Meanwhile, Guest & Co. buy back the old Mill, and Tom, who has made himself valuable to Mr. Deane's firm, is put in charge as manager. Maggie fights against her feeling for Stephen, but he selfishly forces her to admit her love. They go boating on the Floss and are accidentally carried by the tide too far to return. He persuades her to elope with him, but after they have gone some distance her sense of duty to Lucy asserts itself, and she insists upon returning. Tom, now established at the Mill, proves unforgiving and turns her off. She resists Stephen's importunities to marry him, and tries to find occupation, but public opinion is against her. The fall rains swell the Floss, and a heavy flood comes. Maggie, realizing Tom's danger, rows to the Mill to rescue him. The sudden danger wipes out all their misunderstanding, and they face the peril with a renewal of their childish affection. When they have nearly reached safety they are overwhelmed and drowned together. Additional information: 1st edition, Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons, 1860. 3 vols. SCENE: \"St. Ogg's\" (Gainsborough) and vicinity. Time: circa 1830-40 (see note). Note. \u2014The time of the story is somewhat confused. It opens about 1830\u2014Catholic emancipation, and the burning of York Minster, both events of 1829, and the \"Swing\" outrages, 1830, are mentioned in the early chapters \u2014and it covers ten years, as Maggie is nine at the beginning and nineteen when she dies. The flood in which Maggie perishes should therefore have taken place about 1840. The historic great flood mentioned in the last chapter as having taken place sixty years before that in which Maggie and Tom perish actually occurred in 1770, seventy years before. Possibly the \"sixty years\" was reckoned from the beginning rather than the end of the novel. Excerpted from: Mudge, Isadore Gilbert.

Knowing that Fedalma is menaced by the Inquisition, he presses for an immediate marriage. When Fedalma, on learning that Zarca, the captured Gypsy chief, is her long-lost father casts in her lot with him and escapes with him from Bedmar, Duke Silva is broken-hearted. He follows Fedalma to the Gypsy camp, and when he cannot persuade her to return, elects to remain with her and become a Gypsy. Mean while the Moors and Gypsies attack Bedmar, and Silva brought back there finds his trust betrayed, his friends slain and his uncle, Father Isidor, the Inquisitor, about to be executed.

She and the young Duke Silva are betrothed, and when their mamage is near, Fedalma, deeply in love and looking forward to a happy future, learns from the prisoner Zarca that he is her father. When Zarca, a patriot and a visionary, points out to her the needs of her people and all that she can do for them if she will cast in her lot with them, she at first tries to reconcile love and duty, but later makes the sacrifice of her personal happiness, gives up Silva, and joins her father in his escape.

After Zarca captures\nSilva's town of Bedmar, and Silva, desperate with shame, kills Zarca, Fedalma finds herself separated for ever from her lover.

A man of lofty and resolute purpose, capable of putting the claims of his people ahead of all personal considerations, he aspires to fuse together the scattered bands of Gypsies in Spain and lead them to found a Gypsy nation in Africa. At the opening of the poem he is held prisoner by the Spaniards in Bedmar, where he sees the beautiful Fedalm.a, the Duke's betrothed, and recognizes her as his long lost daughter, who had been stolen in childhood by marauding Spaniards. Revealing himself to her, he sets before her the claims of her race and so works upon her with his force and eloquence that she agrees to leave Duke Silva, whom she loves devotedly, and to escape with her father and devote herself to the welfare of her race. After Duke Silva, unable to bear the loss of Fedalma, follows her to the Gypsy camp and for her sake joins the Gypsy band, deserting his post at Bedmar, Zarca, and his Moorish ally, El Zagal, attack and capture Bedmar. Zarca shows some moderation in his victory, although he condemns the inquisitor, Father Isidor, to death, and when Silva, frantic at Father Isidor's death and the thought that the loss of the town is due to his desertion of his post, stabs Zarca, the Gypsy protects him and will not allow his people to harm Silva. Dying, Zarca lays upon Fedalma the solemn duty of taking his place in the leadership of his people. Frederic Harrison has suggested that some traits in the character of Zarca were drawn from Dr. Richard Congreve, the Positivist leader. (See article in the Positivist Review, vol. 10, p. 160.) Congreve himself once declared that the Spanish Gypsy was a \"mass of Positivism\"."

        "desc": "The Spanish Gypsy is the tragic story of two lovers, one of whom, Fedalma, renounces her happiness before the call of what she feels is duty to her race, while the other, Silva, places his love ahead of the obligations of honour and inheritance. George Eliot herself stated plainly the theme of the poem: \"The subject of the Spanish Gypsy was originally suggested to me by a picture which hangs in the Scuola di San Rocco at Venice . . . It is an Annunciation, said to be by Titian . . . here was a great dramatic motive ... A young maiden, believing herself on the eve of the chief event of her life\u2014marriage \u2014about to share in the ordinary lot of woman hood, full of young hope, has suddenly announced to her that she is chosen to fulfil a great destiny, entailing a terribly different experience from that ordinary womanhood ... as a result of foregoing hereditary conditions: she obeys.\" \"In Silva is presented the claim of fidelity to social pledges; in Fedalma the claim constituted by a hereditary lot less consciously shared.\" See Cross, George Eliot's Life, vol. iii, pp. 42, 49. Fedalma, a Gypsy by birth, stolen from her tribe when an infant, has been educated as a high-born Spanish girl in the family of the Duchess Diana, Duke Silva's mother. Silva, the commandant of the fortress of Bedmar, is deeply in love with Fedalma, and the two are betrothed, but their marriage is opposed by the Prior Isidor, the Inquisitor, on the ground that Fedalma is both a Gypsy and a heretic. In order to stop the marriage the Prior means to hand Fedalma over to the Inquisition. A band of Gypsy prisoners are in the town, and the chief of these, Zarca, learns Fedalma's story. Fedalma, dancing in pure lightheartedness and joy of life before the people in the Placa Santiago, is seen by Zarca, who recognizes her as his lost daughter. Zarca gains access to Fedalma, tells her that he is her father, and exhorts her to place her duty to her people before her personal happiness. Fedalma, though deeply in love with Silva, feels the call of her blood, and after at first trying to reconcile duty and happiness, sacrifices her hopes of happiness with Silva and joins her father in escaping from Bedmar. Silva, stricken by her loss, broods over it for a while, relaxing his hold on the thought of duty, and eventually deserts his post at Bedmar to follow her to the Gypsy camp. Zarca, confident of Fedalma's strength of purpose, often her choice, but she elects to abide by her duty to her people, and Silva, seeing no other way of winning her, declares that he will become a Gypsy and take the Gypsy oath. Zarca has patriotic dreams of leading bis people to Africa and establishing a Gypsy nation there, but meantime he allies himself with the Moor, El Zagal, against the Spaniards. While Silva is kept in the Gypsy camp, Zarca and El Zagal attack Bedmar, capture it, and kill Silva's friends. The Prior Isidor is condemned to death. As he is being led to execution, Silva arrives. The Prior curses him aa a traitor, and Silva, desperate at the reproaches and at the thought of the evil which his desertion of his poet has wrought, stabs Zarca. When hie people would kill Silva in return, Zarca magnanimously eaves his life, and dies after laying upon Fedalma the duty of taking his place as leader of the Gypsies. Fedalma takes up the burden and leads her people to Africa after one farewell interview with Silva. Silva takes the habit of a pilgrim and goes to Rome to seek pardon and the right to use his sword again in the service of his country.

His grey eyes, too, shine with unwonted brilliancy this evening. They were not remarkable eyes, but they accorded completely in their changing light with the changing expression of his person, which indicated the paradoxial character often observable in a large-limbed sanguine blond; at once mild and irritable, gentle and overbearing, indolent and resolute, self-con scious and dreamy.\" \"But Mr. Tryan was not cast in the mould of the gratuitous martyr. With a power of persistence which had been often blamed as obstinacy, he had an acute sensibility to the very hatred or ridicule he did not flinch from provoking. Every form of disapproval jarred him painfully; and, though he fronted his opponents manfnlly, and often with considerable warmth of temper, he had no pugnacious pleasure in the contest. It was one of the weaknesses of his nature to be too keenly alive to every harsh wind of opinion.\" In his youth he had been wild, and the realization of his sins had caused him to enter the churoh and to devote his life to others. When he comes to Milby he has to struggle against the indifference of those whom he would help and the malevolent opposition of  Lawyer Dempster. In the end his sympathy, faith, and high purpose give him the victory, for which, however, he pays with his life. He dies happy in the knowledge that, through his influence, Janet Dempster has been rescued from despair. There was undoubtedly an original for the story of the persecution of Mr. Tryan. George Eliot, in 1857, said: \"The story, as far as regards the persecution, is a real bit in the religious history of England that happened about eight and twenty years ago.\" The Reverend W. P. Jones wrote to William Blackwood that Mr. Tryan was drawn from his deceased brother but George Eliot disclaimed this, saying: \"Mr. Tryan is not a portrait of any clergyman, living or dead.\" (See Cross, George Eliot's Life, vol.1, pp. 458, 462.)"

In the town of Milby sentiment is divided over the work of the new Evangelical curate, Mr. Tryan. His own adherents recognize the earnestness and spiritual force of his labours, but the friends of the snuffy old curate, Mr. Crewe, regard Mr. Tryan as a dangerous innovation, to be suppressed at any cost. One of the most vociferous enemies of Mr. Tryan is Robert Dempster, a lawyer of violent character who has taken to drink. Janet, Dempster's beautiful wife, aids the lawyer in his persecution of the curate, helping him prepare a scurrilous poster against Mr. Tryan deriding his Sunday evening lecture, and Mr. Tryan on his way to church is jeered and hissed by a hostile crowd. His persecution of Mr. Tryan costs Dempster some of his good clients, and this still further inflames hie rage. Janet has meanwhile met Mr. Tryan at the home of a sick woman whom both were aiding, and has been impressed with his nobility of character, though she still supports her husband. Janet, who is a woman of noble possibilities, is far from happy. She is often ill-treated, and even beaten, by her brutal husband, and her unhappiness has driven her to seek forgetfulness in drink. In his last fit of anger Dempster turns her out of doors in her nightdress, at midnight, and she seeks refuge with an old friend, Mrs. Pettifer, who is one of Mr. Tryan's adherents. Her unhappiness and despair lead her to remember the impression she has retained of Mr. Tryan's nobility, and she talks with him, and through his aid determines to take up her struggle again and break herself of her habit of drink. Dempster is thrown from his cart when drunk and badly injured, so that he dies from delirium tremens, watched over by Janet, who for the short time that he lives forgets her injuries and remembers only that they once loved each other. After his death Janet has one more period of terrible temptation to return to her habit of drink, but resists it, and, becoming one of Mr. Tryan's most loyal supporters, spends herself in good works. A deep affection develops between her and the curate, but his health fails under his heavy labours, and he dies, beloved arid regretted even by those who had once persecuted him. His living monument in Milby is Janet Dempster, restored to noble womanhood. Note. -The Scenes of Clerical Life were brought to an end with the third story. A fourth story, to be called the \"Clerical Tutor\", had been projected, but was never written.

The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton is the story of a commonplace, rather stupid man, whose rapacity for suffering under his \"sad fortunes\" is as great as that of any tragic hero. Amos Barton, at 40, is curate of Shepperton Church, with a stipend of \u00a380 a year on which he has to support a wife and six children and keep up a respectable clerical appearance. Without the aid of bis wife's cleverness he would be quite unable to make both ends meet, and, as it is, he owes money and has to borrow \u00a320 from the Squire. His wife, Milly Barton, is a beautiful, gracious woman, devoted to her husband and children and beloved by all the parishioners, who for her sake overlook Mr. Barton's blunders and aid the family with occasional gifts. The Countess Czerlaski, a pretty widow with no fortune, who has come to the parish to look for a second husband with money, cultivates the Bartons, and they, in spite of the suspicions of the parish, accept her at her face value, and Mr. Barton believes that she is going to make his fortune by recommending him to someone who has the presentation of a good living. When the Countess quarrels with her brother and leaves his house, the Barton3 good-naturedly take her in for a short time only, as they think, but she quarters herself on them for six months, running them into debt, wearing out poor Milly's strength, and alienating Mr. Barton's parishioners, who regard the matter as scandalous. She is driven away by some home truths which an irate housemaid tells her, and for awhile the Barton fortunes seem brighter. But Milly's strength has been too deeply undermined, and when her seventh child is born she dies, leaving a heartbroken husband who for the first time realizes her full worth. For her sake the parish restores Amos to its favour, but just as he is beginning to feel that he is really surrounded by friends his rector withdraws his curacy, and he sorrowfully goes to a distant parish, finding his only consolation in the reflection of Milly's love which he sees in his daughter Patty. Note. -The Scenes of Clerical Life were brought to an end with the third story. A fourth story, to be called the \"Clerical Tutor\", had been projected, but was never written.

But the perfections of his slim, well-proportioned figure were so striking that no one but a tailor could notice the perfections of his velvet coat; and his small white hands, with their blue veins and taper fingers, quite eclipsed the beauty of his lace ruffles. The face, however\u2014it was difficult to say why\u2014was certainly not pleasing. Nothing could be more delicate than the blond complexion\u2014its bloom set off by the powdered hair\u2014than the veined overhanging eyelids, which gave an indolent expression to the hazel eyes ; nothing more finely cut than the transparent nostril and the short upper-lip. Perhaps the chin nd lower jaw were too small for an irreproachable profile, but the defect was on the side of that delicacy and finesse which was the distinctive characteristic of the whole person, and which was carried out in the clear brown arch of the eyebrows, and the marble smoothness of the sloping forehead.\" He deliberately wins the love of Caterina, his uncle's penniless protegee, without intending to marry her. In response to his uncle's wishes he becomes engaged to the beauty, Miss Assher, and gives no thought to the suffering he causes Caterina. When her jealousy annoys him, his weak heart causes his death. Charles Parker, nephew and heir of Sir Roger Newdigate (\"Sir Christopher Cheverel\") was, in the matter of his personal appearance, his relation to a rich and childless uncle and his sudden death, the original of Captain Wybrow. Captain Wybrow's love affair with Caterina is purely fictitious, however, as Sally Shilton (\"Caterina\") was only a child at the time of Charles Parker's marriage to Miss Anstruther (\"Miss Assher\").

Her large eyes seem all the more striking because the dark hair is gathered away from her face, under a little cap set at the top of her head, with a cherry colored bow on one side. \"With one exception, her only talent lay in loving ; and there, it is probable, the most astronomical of women could not have surpassed her. Orphan and protegee though she was, this supreme talent of hers found plenty of exercise at Cheverel Manor . . . the one other exceptional talent, you already guess, was music.\" \"Said Mr. Bates, 'for she hasn't the cut of a gell as must work for her bread; she's as nesh an' dilicate as a paichblossom\u2014welly laike a linnet, wi' on'y joost body anoof to hold her voice.' \" She falls in love with the handsome unscrupulous Captain Wybrow, and when he heartlessly forsakes her for Miss Assher, she is maddened by jealousy. She goes to meet him in the Rookery, thinking that she will kill him. When she reaches the Rookery she finds him dead. Many months later, when she has partially recovered from the shock, her affectionate heart leads her to marry Mr. Gilfil, her faithful lover, but she lives only a few months after their marriage.

He had a large heap of short sermons, rather yellow and worn at the edges, from which he took two every Sunday, securing perfect impartiality in the selection by taking them as they came without reference to topics; and having preached one of these sermons at Shepperton in the morning, he mounted his horse and rode hastily with the other in his pocket to Knebley, where he officiated in a wonderful little church .... Here, in an absence of mind to which he was prone, Mr. Gillil would sometimes forget to take off his spurs before putting on his surplice, and only become aware of the omission by feeling something mysteriously tugging at the skirts of that garment as he stepped into the reading-desk.\" \"The dear old Vicar, though he had something of the knotted whimsical character of the poor lopped oak, had yet been sketched out by nature as a noble tree. The heart of him was sound, the grain was of the finest, and in the grey-haired man who filled his pocket with sugar-plums for the little children, whose most biting words were directed against the evil-doing of the rich man, and who, with all his social pipes and slipshod talk, never sank below the highest level of his parishioners' respect, there was the main trunk of the same brave, faithful, tender nature that had poured out the finest, freshest forces of its life-current in a first and only love\u2014the love of Tina.\" All through his youth he loves the little Italian, Caterina, and tries to watch over her during her unhappy love affair with the worthless Captain Wybrow. After she partially recovers from the shock of Captain Wybrow's death he marries her, and has a few months of great happiness as her husband. When she dies, that side of his life is closed forever, and he lives a solitary life among his parishioners, all of whom admire and respect him greatly. The Reverend Bernard Gilpin Ebdell, who married Sally Shilton (\"Caterina\"), was the original of Maynard Gilfil. It has been suggested that some touches in his character are taken from the Reverend Henry Hake, vicar of Chilvers Coton from 1844- 1859. (See Andrews, Bygone Warwickshire, p. 271 ; Olcott, George Eliot, pp. 15, 33 ; also article by George Morley in Gentleman's Magazine, n.s., vol. 45, p. 583.) Bernard Gilpin Ebdell, vicar of Chilvers Coton, was the clergyman who, in 1819, baptized Mary Ann Evans. He was vicar 1786-1828."

Sir Christopher Cheverel, a fine old English baronet with a passion for architecture, has spent nearly fifteen years in making over his old Manor House into a beautiful Gothic building. Though he is childless, Cheverel Manor is not without young people. Sir Christopher's ward, Maynard Gilfil, a young man who has just entered the Church, lives there, as does also Lady Cheverel's protegee, Caterina Sarti. Caterina is a young Italian girl with a beautiful voice, who has been a member of the family ever since Lady Cheverel rescued her, when, as a child of only three, she had been left destitute in Milan by her father's death. Sir Christopher intends that Maynard Gilfil and Caterina shall marry, but though Maynard has loved the beautiful Italian from childhood Caterina feels for him only the affection of a sister. Her passionate love has been won by the attentions of Captain Anthony Wybrow, Sir Christopher's nephew and heir, who has amused himself by flirting with Caterina. Following Sir Christopher's wishes, Captain Wybrow courts Beatrice Assher, a rich heiress, and Beatrice, after accepting him, com.es to visit at Cheverel Manor. Caterina, jealous and unhappy, cannot altogether conceal her feelings, and Miss Assher soon begins to suspect some relation between her lover and Caterina. To excuse himself Captain Wybrow leads Beatrice to think that Caterina has given him her love unsought, and Miss Assher reproaches her for such conduct. Frenzied by the unjust accusation, Caterina, who is going to meet Anthony in a part of the grounds called the Rookery, seizes a dagger and takes it with her, thinking that she will kill him. When she reaches the Rookery she finds him lying dead, where he had fallen from an attack of heart disease. The shock makes her forget everything except her former love, and when she faints, after carrying the news to Sir Christopher, Maynard finds the dagger in her possession. Distraught and self-reproachful, Caterina wanders from home the next day, and is eventually found to have sought refuge, worn-out and ill, with her former nurse. The Manor has too many sad associations for her to return there, but after she has spent some months with Mr. Gilfil's sister she recovers sufficiently to return from her unhappy passion to the refuge of Maynard's strong and considerate love. Caterina and Maynard are married, and have a short time of happiness, but she dies within a year, and Maynard's love goes \"with her into deep silence for evermore \". A part of Mr. Gilfil's life closes entirely with her death, and he always shows the effect of the tragedy of his youth, though he lives on for years, the eccentric and whimsical, but always upright and beloved, old vicar of Shepperton. Note. -The Scenes of Clerical Life were brought to an end with the third story. A fourth story, to be called the \"Clerical Tutor\", had been projected, but was never written.
