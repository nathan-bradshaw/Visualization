It is a very fine old place, of red brick, softened by a pale powdery lichen, which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity, so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limest.one ornaments surrounding the three gables, the windows, and the door-place.

The sleeve rolled up above the elbow showed an arm that was likely to win the prize for feats of strength ; yet the long supple hand, with its broad finger tips, looked ready for works of skill. In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon, and justified his name ; but the jetblack hair, made the more notice able by its contrast with the light paper cap, and the keen glance of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly marked, prominent and mobile eyebrows, indicated a mixture of Celtic blood. The face was large and roughly hewn, and when in repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an expression of good-humoured honest intelligence.\\\" Poverty and his father's bad habits had given him much to contend against, but with a strong will he had overcome obstacles, gained an education in Bartle Massey's night school, and made himself a capable artisan, respected by his neighbours for his ability and upright character. At the beginning of the story he is chief workman in Jonathan Burge'a timber yard, with proapects of a partnership eome day, especially if he is willing to marry gentle Mary Burge. He has ideas about timber, and his friend Arthur Donnithome , the heir of the manor, for whom Adam entertains a strong friendship dating from their boyhood, intends to put Adam in charge of the Donnithome woods whenever the old aquire dies. He ie deeply in love with shallow Hetty Sorrel, the village beauty, who, however, ignores him, aa her head has been turned by attentions from Arthur Donnithome. When Adam finds that Arthur has been making love to Hetty, he fights Arthur, in spite of his strong affection for him, and forces him to break with Hetty, not knowing how far the relations between the two had gone. Later Adam becomes engaged to Hetty, but she runs away just before the date set for the wedding. When he learns that she has been arrested and is to be tried for child-murder Adam is overwhelmed with despair, and with rage against Arthur. He stands by Hetty in court, but is implacable against Arthur for a time, although later, won over by Arthur's genuine remorse, he consents to remain on the estate. Eventually he marries Dinah Morris. It is generally agreed that the character of Adam Bede and some of the incidents of hie career are drawn from Robert Evans, George Eliot's father. There are many points of resemblance in character and circumstances, and George Eliot herself admitted this, although she said that Adam was not a portrait of her father.

For Lisbeth is tall, and in other points t.oo there ie a strong likeness between her and her son Adam. Her dark eyes are somewhat dim now-perhaps from t.oo much crying-but her broadly marked eyebrows are still black, her teeth are sound, and as ahe stands knitting rapidly and unconsciously with her work-hardened hands, she has as firmly-upright an attitude as when she is carrying a pail of water on her head from the spring.\\\" She is almost idolatrously devoted to her eldest son, Adam. Desiring him to make a sensible marriage, she is at first opposed to his marrying Hetty Sorrel. She had grown fond of Dinah Morris, when the latter came to comfort her at the time of her husband's death, and it is her desire to bring about a marriage between Adam and Dinah which eventually reveals to Adam his own affection for Dinah.

He has thrown off his paper cap, and you see that his hair is not thick and straight, like Adam's, but thin and wavy, allowing you to discern the exact contour of a coronal arch that predominates very decidedly over the brow.\\\" Less able and ambitious than his energetic elder brother, he is characterized chiefly by his strong religious convictions and his capacity for loyal affection. From the beginning he is in love with Dinah Morris, and more than once asks her to marry him. When he finds that Adam himself is in love with Dinah, he does what he can to help his brother's suit, and later finds his chief happiness in his affection for Dinah and Adam and their children.

If you want to know more particularly how he looked, call to your remembrance some tawny-whiskered, brownlocked, clear-complexioned young Englishman... well-washed, high-bred, white-handed, yet looking as if he could deliver well from the left shoulder, and floor his man: I will not be so much of a tailor as to trouble your imagination with the difference of costume, and insist on the striped waistooat, long-tailed coat, and low topboots.\\\" \\\"His own approbation was necessary to him, and it was not an approbatfon to be enjoyed quite gratuitously; it must be won by a fair amount of merit. He had never yet forfeited that approbation, and he had considerable reliance on his own virtues. No young man could oonfees his faults more candidly; candour was one of his favourite virtues; and how can a man's candour be seen in all its lustre unless he has a few failings to talk of? But he had an agreeable confidence that his faults were all of a generous kind-impetuous, warm-blooded, leonine; never crawling, crafty, reptilian. It was not posaible for Arthur Donnithome to do anything mean, dastardly, or cruel.\\\" He is much liked by his grandfather's tenantry, who look forward to the time when he will be the Squire. As a boy he was much attached to Adam Bede, and this friendship continues after Arthur is grown up, causing him to plan the many things which he will do for Adam when he inherits the estate. At the opening of the story he is invalided home from his regiment with a broken arm, and beguiles the tedium of his inaction by noticing pretty Hetty Sorrel, not knowing that Adam Bede is courting her. Finding that her attraction is becoming too strong, he resolves to break away, but cannot keep his good resolution and ends by really falling in love with her, without any idea on his part of marriage, although Hetty believes that he will marry her. When Adam finds Hetty and Arthur together, he and Arthur fight, and the latter, forced to it by Adam who does not know how far things have gone, writes a letter to Hetty breaking off their relationship, but telling her how to reach him if she needs him, and then joins his regiment. When he learns that Adam and Hetty are to be married he is relieved that the affair has ended so well, and salves his conscience with the thought of the kind things that he means to do for them. His remorse is great when, called home by his grandfather's death, he learns that Hetty is being tried on the charge of murdering his child and hers. At the very last minute he succeeds in having her sentence of death commuted to transportation, and then exiles himself from home, to the army on the Contment.\"}, {\"name\": \"Donnithorne, Miss Lydia\", \"desc\": \"Squire Donnithorne's spinster daughter who presides over his household and is tyrannized over by her father.\"}, {\"name\": \"Downes, Bill\", \"desc\": \"Stone-sawyer, a pupil in Bartle Massey's night school who wins the donkey race at the birthday games.\"}, {\"name\": \"D'Oyley\", \"desc\": \"A former inhabitant of Treddleston.\"}, {\"name\": \"Dummilow, Archie\", \"desc\": \"A poor old man in Broxton village.\"}, {\"name\": \"Fido\", \"desc\": \"Miss Lydia Donnithorne's pet dog.\"}, {\"name\": \"Fletcher, Mrs.\", \"desc\": \"One of the women preachers among the Methodists, of whom Dinah Morris talks.

To Adam Bede, who had been a pupil in his night-school, Bartle Massey is a loyal friend, giving up all of his own interests to go to Stoniton to stay with Adam during Hetty Sorrel's trial. Bartle Massey is one of the real named used by George Eliot in Adam Bede. The master of the school which her father, Robert Evans (\\\"Adam Bede \\\") attended near Roston, was named Bartle Massey, and, according to the account of him given by Mottram, had some of the characteristics of the Bartle Massey of the story.

There was no keenness in the eyes; they seemed rather to be shedding love than making observations; they had the liquid look which tells that the mind is full of what it has to give out, rather than impressed by external objects. She stood with her left hand towards the descending sun, and leafy boughs screened her from its rays; but in this sober light the delicate colouring of her face seemed to gather a calm vividness, like flowers at evening. It was a small oval face, of a uniform transparent whiteness, with an egg-like line of cheek and chin, a full but firm mouth, a delicate nostril, and a low perpendicular brow, burmounted by a rising arch of parting between smooth locks of pale reddish hair. The hair was drawn straight back behind the ears, and covered, except for an inch or two, above the brow, by a net Quaker cap. The eyebrows, of the same colour as the hair, were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled; the eyelashes, though no darker, were long and abundant; nothing was left blurred or unfinished. It was one of those faces that make one think of white flowers with light touches of colour on their pure petals. The eyes had no peculiar beauty, beyond that of expression; they looked so simple, so candid, so gravely loving, that no accusing scowl, no light sneer could help melting away before their glance.\\\" She lives at Snowfield, where she works in a mill, but at the opening of the story she is visiting her aunt at Hayslope, where she preaches movingly on the village Green. Seth Bede has long been in love with her, but Adam Bede has never seen her until, at the time of his father's death, she comes to his cottage to help his grief-stricken mother. Her sense of religious duty causes her to try to lead vain little Hetty Sorrel to a higher life, and while she produces no religious impression on Hetty, she leaves with her a sense of love which makes the girl turn to her later in her despair. Dinah is away from home when Hetty is tried for murder and sentenced to death, but she hurries to Hetty's prison as soon as the news reaches her, and there prays and talks with the stricken girl until she touches her heart and induces her to make the confession which she had obstinately refused to make. She goes with Hetty to the place of execution, and is with her when the reprieve arrives at the last minute. When his grief about Hetty has been somewhat softened, Adam Bede discovers that he is in love with Dinah, and eventually she marries him. The original of Dinah\\nMorris was Elizabeth Evans, the wife of George Eliot's uncle, Samuel Evans, al though, as George Eliot herself says, the character is not an exact portrait. Mrs. Evans, whom George Eliot speaks of as \\\"my Methodist Aunt Samuel\\\", was an eloquent and well-known Wesleyan preacher, and some of her characteristics and experiences appear in Dinah Morris. One of Elizabeth Evans's striking experiences, when she induced an ignorant girl who had been convicted of child-murder to make a confession, and afterwards rode in the cart with her to the place of execution, gave George Eliot the idea for the climax of Adam Bede. Her connexion with Dinah Morris has been commemorated in the table erected to her memory in the Ebenezer Wesleyan Chapel in Wirksworth (\\\"Snowfield\\\") which reads \\\"Elizabeth Evans, known to the world as Dinah Bede\\\".

Mr. Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg, and suspected that the growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs, had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human calf.

The family likeness between her and her niece Dinah Morris, with the contrast between her keenness and Dinah's seraphic gentleness of expression, might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and Mary. Their eyes were just of the same colour, but a striking test of the difference in their operation was seen in the\\ndemeanour of Trip, the black--andtan terrier, whenever that muchsuspected dog unwarily exposed himself to the freezing arctic ray of Mrs. Poyser's glance.

She's quite original in her talk, too; one of those untaught wits that help to stock a country with proverbs. I told you that capital thing I heard her say about Craig--that he was like a cock who thought the sun had risen to hear him crow. Now that's an Aesop's fable in a sentence.\\\" She is a pattern dairywoman and housekeeper, with standards of excellence which none of her much-berated maids, even under the spur of her sharp tongue, ever succeeds in living up to. She keeps her eyes open for her neighbours' foibles and weaknesses, summing them up in keen, though homely, epigrams, and is strict with her husband's niece, Hetty Sorrel, whom she rightly suspects of selfishness and vanity. When the parsimonious Squire Donnithorne tries to impose upon her good-natured husband, Mrs. Poyser \\\"speaks her mind, to the Squire, routing him in a battle of words which delights the whole neighbourhood. In spite of her sharp tongue she is a kindly woman, much attached to her family and fond of her niece Dinah Morris, whose saintliness she appreciates though she does not approve of her Methodism and self-denial.

The name Poyser was a real name in the neighbourhood of Ellastone (the \\\"Hayslope\\\" of Adam Bede), and an actual Mrs. Poyser, a farmer's wife, is said to have lived there at the time when George Eliot's father, Robert Evans, was still in Ellastone. A writer in Notes and Queries, whose father had been clerk to William Evans, George Eliot's uncle, states that a Mrs. Poyser was Mr. William Evans' housekeeper, which might explain the use of the name.

It is a beauty like that of kittens, or very small downy ducks making gentle rippling noises with their soft bills, or babies just beginning to toddle and to engage in conscious mischief--a beauty with which you can never be angry, but that you feel ready to crush for inability to comprehend the state of mind into which it throws you. Hetty Sorrel's was that sort of beauty.\\\" \\\"It is of little use for me to tell you that Hetty's cheek was like a rose--petal, that dimples played about her pouting lips, that her large dark eyes hid a soft roguishness under their long lashes, and that her curly hair, though all pushed back under her round cap while she was at work, stole back in dark delicate rings on her forehead, and about her white shelllike ears; it is of little use for me to say how lovely was the contour of her pink-and-white neckerchief, tucked into her low plum-coloured stuff boddice, or how the linen butter-making apron, with its bib, seemed a thing to be imitated in silk by duchesses, since it fell in such charming lines, or how her brown stockings and thick-soled buckled shoes lost all that clumsiness which they must certainly have had when empty of her foot and ankle; of little use, unless you have seen a woman who affected you as Hetty affected her beholders, for otherwise, though you might conjure up the image of a lovely woman, she would not in the least resemble that distracting kittenlike maiden ... Hetty's was a spring-tide beauty; it was the beauty of young frisking things, round-limbed, gambolling, circumventing you by a false air of innocence.\\\" Although she has been brought up by Mr. Poyser as if she had been his own daughter, she is incapable of feeling any gratitude and affection for him or his family. Her beauty attracts village suitors, including honest Adam Bede, whom her uncle favours, but she believes that her beauty destines her for a higher station. When she attracts the attention of the young squire, Arthur Donnithome, she sees a rosy future for herself, ignorantly thinking that his passion, to which she has secretly yielded, must end in marriage. When Arthur Donnithome breaks off his affair with her she is humiliated and sick at heart, but, later, seeing nothing better in the future, promises to marry Adam who is in ignorance of what her real relations with Arthur have been. As the time for their marriage approaches, Hetty realizes that the truth must soon come to light, and, under pretence of visiting Dinah Morris at Snowfield, journeys to Windsor to find Arthur Donnithome and then not finding him, journeys back in despair, lacking the courage to kill herself, but determined to keep her disgrace from her family. On her way back her baby is born. She leaves it in a wood to die, and is arrested for child-murder, tried and sentenced to death. Through her trial and sentence she maintains a hard, obstinate silence, which breaks down only when Dinah Morris goes to her in prison and spends the last night in her cell, pleading with her to confess. Dinah accompanies her to the place of execution, and at the last minute Hetty's sentence is commuted to transportation, from which she never returns. While Hetty herself is not a portrait, her tragedy, and, indeed, the germ of the plot of Adam Bede, were taken from a dramatic experience in the life of George Eliot's aunt, Elizabeth Evans (\\\"Dinah Morris\\\").

It was a finely typical Jewish face, wrought into intensity of expression apparently by a strenuous eager experience in which all the satisfaction had been indirect and far off, and perhaps by some bodily suffering also, which involved that absence of ease in the present. The feature were clear-cut, not large; the brow not high, but broad, and fully defined by the crisp black hair. It might never have been a particularly handsome face, but it must always have been forcible.\\\" \\\"A man steeped in poverty and obscurity, weakened by disease, consciously within the shadow of advancing death, but living an intense life in an invisible past and future, careless of his personal lot, except for its possibly making some obstruction to a conceived good which he would never share except as a brief inward vision--a day afar off, whose sun would never warm him, but into which he threw his sou's desire, with a passion often wanting to the personal motives of healthy youth.\\\" His whole life is wrapped up in his belief in the regeneration of a great Jewish nationality in Palestine if only the right leader of the race can be found. As a young man he had started east to work in Palestine, when he was recalled because his mother needed his help after her husband had deserted her. The need of caring for his mother and the consumption which he develops from exposure make him give up the idea of his own leadership, and when Daniel Deronda meets him he is living in semi-poverty as a watch mender in the Cohen pawnshop and an off-hour attendant in Mr. Ram's book shop, constantly hoping to find the leader on whom his mantle can descend. He sees in Deronda this destined leader, introduces Deronda to the Philosphers' Club at the \\\"Hand and Banner\\\", and rouses his keen interest both in the Jewish race and in the thought that he may be a Jew himself. Throught Deronda's instrumentality, his relationship to Mirah is discovered, and after Deronda and Mirah are married he dies happy in the belief that they will realize his dream. The original of Mordecai was a Jewish journeyman watchmaker, name Cohn, or Kohn, who was president of a philosophical club in Red Lion Square, which G. H. Lewes frequented in his youth, and which he describes in the Fortnightly Review, vol. 4, p. 386. To the personal characteristics of this Cohn, as Lewes described him, George Eliot added the belief in a renewed Jewish nationality, which she is said to have taken from a Moldavian Jew possessed of the same idea whom she met in Munich.

Then see the perfect cameo her profile maeks, cut in a duskish shell where by some happy fortune there pierced a gem-like darkness for the eye and eyebrow; the delicate nostrils defined enough to be ready for sensitive movements, the finished ear, the firm curves of the chin and neck entering into the expression of a refinement which was not feebleness.\\\" When she was a young child her father, an actor, had taken her away from her mother and brother, and for many years they led a Bohemian life distasteful to Mirah, who was strongly attached to the Jewish faith. In order to escape the dishonourable attentions of a man seconded by her father, she runs away from her father and comes to London to seek her mother and brother.

Look at his hands... they are long, flexible, firmly grasping hands, such as Titian has painted in a picture where he wanted to show the combination of refinement with force. And there is something of a likeness, too, between the faces belonging to the hands--in both the uniform pale-brown skin, the perpendicular brow, the calmly penetrating eyes.\\\" \\\"His eyes had a peculiarity which has drawn many men into trouble; they were of a dark yet mild intensity, which seemed to express a special interest in every one on whom he fixed them, and might easily help to bring on him those claims which ardently sympathetic people are often creating in the minds of those who need help.\\\" \\\"To say that Deronda was romantic would be to misrepresent him; but under his calm and somewhat self-repressed exterior there was a fervour which made him easily find poetry and romance among the events of every-day life.\\\" As a child he had been brought to England by Sir Hugo and educated as one of his own family. He is sensitive about his ignorance of his parentage, though much attached to Sir Hugo whom he believes to be his father, and his equivocal position makes him restless and unsettled. At the opening of the story he sees Gwendolen Harleth gambling at Leubronn, and his disapproval disturbs her then and influences her later, when, after her return to England, she marries Grandcourt, Sir Hugo's nephew, and she and Deronda are thus thrown together in the same social circle. While rowing on the Thames Deronda saves Mirah Cohen, a beautiful Jewess who is attempting suicide, finding a refuge for her with his friends the Meyricks and continuing to watch over her. In his efforts to trace Mirah's lost brother, Ezra, he forms a strong friendship with Mordecai Cohen, becomes interested in Jewish questions through him, and eventually discovers that Mordecai is Mirah's brother Ezra and falls in love with Mirah. Meanwhile he feels a different kind of interest in Gwendolen who, in the unhappiness of her marriage, appeals to him for advice and guidance. When his acquaintance with Mordecai and Mirah has thoroughly aroused his interest in the Jews, he is summoned to Genoa to meet his hitherto unknown mother, the Princess Halm-Eberstein, learns from her that he is a Jew, and rejoices in the information. While he is still at Genoa, Grandcourt is drowned in the Mediterranean, and Deronda supports Gwendolen in her remorse and despair, and later she turns to him as her one source of help. On his return to England he devotes himself to work for the Jews, marries Mirah, and with her goes to Palestine to try to realize Mordecai's dream of a revival of Jewish nationalism. According to Sir Leslie Stephen, Edmund Gurney (1847-1888) may have been, in sorne respects at least, the original of Daniel Deronda. Deronda's personal appearance was taken from the Christ in Titian's picture, the \\\"Tribute Money\\\", which haunted George Eliot for years after she had seen it in the Dresden gallery.

He comes to Diplow with some idea of courting the rich Miss Arrowpoint, but is attracted by Gwendolen Harleth's beauty and independence, and, led on by the fact that she holds him off and even goes away to escape his attentions, makes up his mind to marry her. For a while he feels as much liking for her as his worn-out nature permits, but her attitude toward Deronda, innocent though it is, arouses his jealousy and he determines to break her spirit and bend her to his idea of what his wife should be, heedless of the hatred which this arouses in her.

At her father's wish she had married her cousin Charisi, but had bent his gentle nature to her will and had gone on the stage, where her wonderful voice and acting made her the leading prima donna of her time. With all her ambition centred on a great career she had no love for her baby (Daniel), and after her husband's early death she persuaded Sir Hugo Mallinger, one of her admirers, to take Daniel to England and bring him up in ignorance of his birth. Some time after, thinking that her voice was failing, she married the Prince Halm-Eberstein and retired from the stage. Believing that she had done the best thing for Daniel in having him brought up as a Christian Englishman, she had never intended to reveal herself to him, but when suffering from an incurable disease she becomes conscience stricken at the thought that she has thwarted her father's desire to have a grandson, and summons Deronda to meet her at Genoa, where she makes her self and his race known to him without responding in any way to the affection which he offers her. In his Life and Writings of Isaac Disraeli, by his Son, Benjamin Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield, gives an account of Isaac Disraeli's mother, which in some respects, particularly her intense resentment of her race and its social disadvantages and her lack of affection for her son, so resembles the Princess Halm-Eberstein, that it seems probable that George Eliot must have taken some touches in the portrait of Deronda's mother, and in the scene be tween mother and son, from this original.

Promising Mrs. Glasher not to marry Grandcourt, she goes away to escape his attentions, gambles at Leubronn, where she is influenced by seeing Daniel Deronda as she is losing, and is called home by the news that all her mother's property has been lost. As the only way of earning money herself which she can find is a hated position as governess, she marries Grandcourt in spite of her promise to Mrs. Glasher, attempting to quiet her conscience by the plea that she is doing it for her mother, to whom she is really attached. The false position in which she finds herself soon makes her unhappy, and she turns to Daniel Deronda, whose effect on her at Leubronn she has not forgotten, for spiritual aid, thereby arousing her husband's resentment and jealousy. Grandcourt's cruel and contemptuous attitude so arouses her hatred that she trifles with the idea that she could kill him, and when he is drowned before her eyes, she feels that her momentary delay in throwing him a rope makes her a murderess. In her remorse and despair she turns to Deronda as her only help, and from him gradually attains the beginning of a new spiritual attitude and unselfishness. When George Eliot was at Homburg in 1872 she was much impressed by a young lady whom she saw gambling there. This incident furnished the model for Gwendolen Harleth's gambling at Leubronn.

The striking points in his face were large clear grey eyes and full lips.\\\" \\\"His strong health, his renunciation of selfish claims, his habitual preoccupation with large thoughts and with purposes in dependent of everyday casualties, secured him a fine and even temper, free from moodiness or irritability. He was full of longsuffering towards his unwise mother ... he had chosen to fill his days in a way that required the utmost exertion of patience, that required those little rill-like out-flowings of goodness which in minds of great energy must be fed from deep sources of thought and passionate devotedness. In this way his energies served to make him gentle; and now, in this twenty-sixth year of his life, they had ceased to make him angry, except in the presence of something that roused his deep indignation.\\\" He has been well educated and could live in comfortalbe and \\\"respectable\\\" circumstances, but prefers to give up outside refinements to live in poverty among the people whom he wishes to serve. His father had invented some quack medicines upon the sale of which his widowed mother lived comfortably, but Felix, who knows that the medicines are worthless, forces her to give up selling them, and provides for her himself. Mrs. Holt, who objects strongly to giving up the medicines, asks the Reverend Mr. Lyon to reason with Felix, and through the minister Felix meets Esther, with whom he soon falls in love, although at first he sees only surface qualities and faults about which he lectures her. He is interested in the parliamentary campaign in which Harold Transome is the Radical candidate, and fears that some of the practices which he has seen will result in trouble. When a serious election riot does occur, Felix tries to turn the mob and unintentionally kills a constable. He is tried for manslaughter and sentenced to four years' imprisonment in spite of the testimony of his friends, including Esther Lyon, who is now known to be the rightful possessor of the Transome estates. Eventually he is pardoned and learns that Esther has given up wealth and position because she returns his love. The two are married and move away from Treby.

Her money all went in the gratification of these nice tastes, and she saved nothing from her earnings . . . she hated all meanness, would empty her purse impulsively on some sudden appeal to her pity, and if she found out that her father had a want she would supply it with some pretty device of a surprise.\\\" She had been brought up as the daughter of Rufus Lyon, the Independent minister, and while fond of her father has little sympathy with his simple tastes and life. Through her father she meets Felix Holt. and while at first repelled by his surface roughness, soon becomes interested in him and in the lectures that he gives her. Fearing that she may hear the story from someone else, Rufus Lyon tells her that he is not her real father, and that she is the daughter of Maurice Christian Bycliffe. She is much touched by his story of his devotion and marriage to her mother, and gains a different appreciation of his life and character. Later, after she learns that she is the rightful owner of the Transome estates, she goes to Transome Court to visit Mrs. Transome, and there is courted by Harold Transome. What she sees at Transome Court shows her that wealth does not necessarily bring happiness, and as Felix Holt's trial for manslaughter has opened her eyes to the strength of her real feeling for him, she gives up her claim to the estate to marry Felix. While George Eliot's portrait of Esther Lyon is not autobiographic to anything like the same extent as that of the character of Maggie Tulliver (in Mill on the Floss), there are some things in it--the fastidiousness, niceness about dress, etc.-for which the author's own tastes and habits supplied the original.

Rufus\", \"desc\": \"The ardent minister of the Independent Chapel in Treby Magna, and Esther Lyon's reputed father, a man of many lovable oddities and much nobility of character. \\\"He was walking about now, with his hands clasped behind him, an attitude in which his body seemed to bear about the same proportion to his head as the lower part of a stone Hermes bears to the carven image that crowns it. His face looked old and worn, yet the curtain of hair that fell from his bald crown and hung about his neck retained much of its original auburn tint, and his large, brown, short-sighted eyes were still clear and bright. At the first glance, every one thought him a very odd-looking rusty old man; the free-school boys often hooted after him and called him \\\"Revelations\\\"; and to many respectable church people old Lyon's little legs and large head seemed to make Dissent additionally preposterous. But he was too shortsighted to notice those who tittered at him-too absent from the world of small facts and petty impulses in which titterers live.\\\" \\\"Once in his life he had been blinded, deafened, hurried along by rebellious impulse ; he had gone astray after his own desires, and had let the fire die out on the altar ; and as the true penitent, hating his self-besotted error, asks from all coming life duty instead of joy, and service instead of ease, so Rufus was perpetually on the watch lest he should ever again postpone to some private affection a great public opportunity which to him was equivalent to a command.\\\" Twenty-two years before the opening of the story Rufus Lyon was an eloquent and successful minister of a large Independent Chapel, when Annette Ledru came suddenly into his life. The death of her husband, Maurice Christian Bycliffe, had left her penniless in a strange land, and Mr. Lyon took her and her baby into his home, in spite of the criticism of his congregation, fell deeply in love with her, and gave up his high calling to watch over her and her child. After a time the grateful Annette married him and when she died, three years later, he returned to the ministry, and brought up the baby, Esther, as his own daughter. At the opening of the story he is leading, in humble surroundings, a life of wrapt absorption in his work and loving devotion to Esther, who still believes herself his daughter. When events make him believe that she should no longer be kept in ignorance of her parentage he tells her the full story and leaves her free to decide whether or not she will claim the inheritance and rank to which she is apparently entitled. The original of Rufus Lyon was the Reverend Francis Franklin, a Baptist minister, who for fifty-four years, from 1799 until his death in 1852, was pastor of the Cow Lane Chapel, in Coventry. Mr. Franklin was the father of the Misses Franklin, whose school in Coventry George Eliot attended, and the character of Rufus Lyon is said by those who remembered him, to be a faithful portrait.

Her tight-fitting black dress was much worn; the fine lace of her cuffs and collar, and of the small veil which fell backwards over her high comb, was visibly mended; but rare jewels flashed on her hands, which lay on her folded black-clad arms, like finely cut onyx cameos ... \\\" \\\"Crosses, mortifications, money cares, conscious blameworthiness, had changed the aspect of the world for her; there was anxiety in the morning sunlight ; there was unkind triumph or disapproving pity in the glances of greeting neighbours . . . Mrs. Transome, whose imperious will had availed little to ward off the great evils of her life, found the opiate for her discontent in the exertion of her will about smaller things. She was not cruel, and could not enjoy thoroughly what I she called the old woman's pleasure of tormenting; but she liked every little sign of power her lot had left her. She liked that a tenant should stand bareheaded below her as she eat on horseback. She liked to insist that work done without her orders should be undone from beginning to end ... a woman's keen sensibility and dread ... lay screened behind all her petty habits and narrow notions.\\\" As a proud young beauty of good family but little money, she had made a loveless marriage with the feeble Mr. Transome. Feeling no fondnees for either her husband or her half-idiot eldest son, she had responded to the attentions of the handsome young lawyer, Jermyn, and later had centred all her love and pride in her second son, Harold, a healthy handsome boy. Her dominating nature makes her enjoy managing the estate in place of her feeble husband, but lawsuits and the charges which the unscrupulous Jermyn has fastened on the estate have greatly reduced the income. On the death of her disreputable eldest son she eagerly anticipates Harold's return from the East, where he has gone to make his fortune, and expects to find in his devotion a solace for all her dissatisfactions. She is bitterly disappointed when, instead of this devotion, he gives her merely a good-humoured, condescending affection; feels the loss of authority when he does not defer to her about the management of the estate; and watches with helpless dread the growing antagonism between him and Jermyn. Finally, when Jermyn, in a public quarrel, tells Harold that he is his father, her unhappy secret is revealed to her son.

He was addicted at once to rebellion and to conformity, and only an intimate personal knowledge could enable any one to predict where his conformity would begin . . . In fact, Harold Transome was a clever, frank, good-natured egoist; not stringently consistent, but without any disposition to falsity; proud, but with a pride that was moulded in an individual rather than an hereditary form; unspeculative, unsentimental, unsympathetic; fond of sensual pleasures, but disinclined to all vice, and ttached as a healthy, clear sighted person, to all conventional morality, construed with a certain freedom.\\\" In his youth he had gone to the East, where he married a Greek woman, originally a slave, and made a fortune.

Law was a sort of cockfight, in which it was the business of injured honesty to get a game bird with the best pluck and the strongest spurs.\\\" He is devoted to Maggie, \\\"the little wench,\\\" and generous to his less fortunate sister, Mrs. Moss, but his hot temper leads him into numerous lawsuits and eventually he loses Dorlcote Mill and becomes bankrupt. In order to save money for his creditors he manages the mill for his enemy, Lawyer Wakem, who has purchased it. When his debts are paid he gives way to his temper and hate, violently assaults Mr. Wakem. and dies from the shock to his enfeebled system. It has been suggeeted that a certain Tom Hollick, a farmer and miller of Nuneaton, whose mill George Eliot used to pass on her way to school, may have been the original of Mr. Tulliver. Hollick was described by one who remembered him as a sanguine high-tempered man, impatient of any attempt to impose upon him, who was involved in a lawsuit. (Manuscript information; also article in Great Thoughts, March, 1901, p. 370.) Mr. Tulliver is not George Eliot's father, although the tender affection which Mr. Tulliver feels for Maggie may be drawn from the author's recollection of her own father.\"}, {\"name\": \"Tulliver, Mrs. Elizabeth (Bessy)\", \"desc\": \"Maggie and Tom Tulliver's mother ; the handsomest and stupidest of the Dodson sisters, \\\"a blonde, comely woman,\\\" utterly without any sense of humour. \\\"Mrs. Tulliver was what is called a good-tempered person\\u2014 never cried, when she was a baby, on any slighter ground than hunger and pins; and from the cradle upwards had been healthy, fair, plump, and dull-witted; in short, the flower of her family for beauty and amiability. But milk and mildness are not the best things for keeping.\\\" \\\"Mrs. Tulliver was a thorough Dodson, though a mild one, as small-beer, so long as it is any thing, is only describable as very weak ale; and though she had groaned alittle in her youth under the yoke of her elder sisters, and still shed occasional tears at their sisterly reproaches, it was not in Mrs. Tulliver to be an innovator on the family ideas. She was thankful to have been a Dodson, and to have one child who took after her own family.\\\" She bemoans the fact that Maggie is not a Dodson like her cousin, Lucy, and when Mr. Tulliver fails and she loses her cherished household gods her little world is upset, and she does not know how to readjust herself. In spite of her preference for her son Tom, as \\\"the child who took after her own family\\\", she stands by Maggie when Tom turns against his sister.\"}, {\"name\": \"Tulliver, Maggie\", \"desc\": \"A clever, imaginative, undisciplined girl, with an intense craving for love and a longing for happiness. \\\"Maggie, in her brown frock, with her eyes reddened and her heavy hair pushed back, looking from the bed where her father lay, to the dull walls of this sad chamber which was the centre of her world, was a creature full of eager, passionate longings for all that was beautiful and glad; thirsty for all knowledge; with an ear straining after dreamy music that died away and would not come near to her; with a blind unconscious yearning for something that would link together the wonderful impressions of this mysterious life, and give er soul a sense of home in it.\\\" \\\"When Maggie was not angry, she was as dependent on kind or cold words as a daisy on the sun shine or the cloud; the need of being loved would always subdue her.\\\" As a child she is devoted to her brother Tom and passionately fond of her father, who takes her part when she rebels against the traditions of her mother and all the Dodsons. She leads a life of ups and downs, happy with her brother and her books or miserable in her attic to which she flies for refuge. After her father fails she is inspired by her reading of Thomas a Kempis to lead a life of self-renunciation and repression. In the Red Deeps she renews her friendship with Philip Wakem, the cripple, who had been at school with Tom. When he declares his love for her she mistakes affection for him for love. After some time her brother Tom discovers that she and Philip are meeting and brutally forces Maggie to renounce Philip. When, at nineteen, she has developed into a beauty with wonderful dark eyes, she meets her cousin Lucy's lover, Stephen Guest, and he falls in love with her. In spite of the fact that she is still fond of Philip she ends by returning Stephen's love, although struggling against it. While boating on the Floss they are accidentally carried too far by the tide, and Maggie at first thinks that she will yield to Stephen's desire to continue the journey and be married, but her better nature triumphs, and she leaves him to return courageously to her family. Her brother refuses to forgive her and disowns her. They are united only when they lose their lives together in the flood, when Maggie attempts to rescue Tom. \\\"Brother and sister had gone down in an embrace never to be parted; living through again in one supreme moment the days when they had clasped their hands in love, and roamed the daisied fields together.\\\" The original of Maggie Tulliver, more particularly in childhood, was George Eliot herself, and the first part of the story is largely autobiographic. Mr. Cross says: \\\"No doubt the early part of Maggie's portraiture is the best autobiographical representation we can have of George Eliot's own feelings in her childhood, and many of the incidents in the book are based on real experiences of family life\\u2014but . . . mixed with fictitious elements and situations.\\\" (See Cross, George Eliot's Life, vol. 1, p. 31; see also Stephen, George Eliot, p. 87.)\"}, {\"name\": \"Tulliver, Ralph\", \"desc\": \"Mr. Tulliver's ancestor, a clever fellow who had ruined himself.\"}, {\"name\": \"Tulliver, Tom\", \"desc\": \"Maggie's brother; a self-reliant, obstinate, clear-sighted young fellow, stupid with books, but possessing great common sense. \\\"He was one of those lads that grow everywhere in England, and, at twelve or thirteen years of age, look as much alike as goslings: a lad with light-brown hair, cheeks of cream and roses, full lips, indeterminate nose and eye brows\\u2014a physiognomy in which it seems impossible to discern anything but the generic character of boyhood; as different as possible from poor Maggie's phiz, which Nature seemed to have moulded and coloured with the most decided intention.\\\" \\\"Tom never did the same sort of foolish things as Maggie, having a wonderful, instinctive discernment of what would turn to his advantage or disadvantage; and so it happened, that though he was much more wilful and inflexible than Maggie, his mother hardly ever called him naughty. But if Tom did make a mistake of that sort, he espoused it, and stood by it; he 'didn't mind' . . . If Tom Tulliver whipped a gate, he was convinced, not that the whipping of gates by all boys was a justifiable act, but that he, Tom Tulliver was justifiable in whipping that particular gate, and he wasn't going to be sorry.\\\" As a child he rules his young, loving sister with a firm and often hard hand. When Mr. Tulliver fails, Tom manfully goes to work with his Uncle Deane's firm and after a few years of hard work and self denial he is able to help his father pay his debts. He shares his father's hatred of Lawyer Wakem, and ruthlessly puts an end to the love affair between Maggie and Philip Wakem, his former schoolmate. He disowns Maggie after her flight with Stephen Guest, and is reconciled to her only when she rows to the Mill to rescue him and the two are drowned together in the flooded Floss. The original of Tom Tulliver, in part at least, was George Eliot's elder brother, Isaac Evans, to whom she was much attached.

Most men would have married again under his circumstances, but he was said to be more tender to his deformed son than most men were to their best-shapen off-spring.\\\" In Mr. Tulliver's lawsuits, Mr. Wakem manages the cases for his opponents, hence Mr. Tulliver regards him as a creation of Old Harry.

They are parted for a time but his love for her is his strongest feeling and he believes that he has overcome most of the obstacles in their way until Maggie and Stephen Guest fall in love.

She dislikes Mr. Casaubon, to whose blinking and moles she strongly objects. After Dorothea marries Mr. Casaubon, Celia makes a very happy marriage with the correct Sir James Chettam, and feels an affectionate superiority to her sister, as one who has managed her life less well. her real affection for Dorothea does not allow her to be parted from her, even when she greatly disapproves of her second marriage.

She was usually spoken of as being remakably clever, but with the addition that sister Celia had more common-sense.\\\" \\\"She came into the drawing room in her silver-grey dress--the simple lines of her dark brown hair parted over her brown and coiled massively behind, in keeping with the entire absence from her manner and expression of all searc after mere effect. Sometimes when Dorothea was in the company there seemed to be as complete an air of repose about her as if she had been a picture of Santa Barbara.\\\" \\\"The intensity of her religious disposition, the coercion it exercised over her life was but one aspect of a nature altogether ardent, theoretic and intellectually consequent; and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow teaching, hemmed in by social life which seemed nothing but a labyrinth of petty courses, a walled-in maze of small paths that led no whither, the outcome was sure to strike others as at once exaggeration and inconsistency.\\\" Dorothea at nineteen marries the middle-aged and pedantic Mr. Casaubon because she is in love with the idea of being a helpmate to him in his great work. She soon realizes that she has idealized her husband, who is a cold, jealous, and selfish man, engaged in a work of no real value. Although the shock of the disilluison is great and her intense nature at times rebels, she loyally devotes herself to Mr. Casaubon while he lives. She is on the point of sacrificing her future happiness by making him a promise, which, though she does not know its nature, would have separated her from Will Ladislaw, his young cousin, when Mr. Casaubon dies. Eventually she gives up her social position and Mr. Casaubon's money in order to marry Will Ladislaw. Dorothea's religious side was drawn, recognizably, from letters to George Eliot from Emilia Strong, who became first Mrs. mark Pattison and later Lady Dilke.

If you made her smile, she would show you perfect little teeth; if you made her angry, she would not raise her voice, but would probably say one of the bitterest things you have ever tested the flavour of; if you did her a kindness, she would never forget it.\\\"  As children, she and Fred Vincy had been sweethearts, and no one else ever replaces him in her affections, although she shows much scorn for his imperfections, and steadily opposes his plan of taking orders, for which she thinks he is not suited.

The first impression on seeing Will was one of sunny brightness, which added to the uncertainty of his changing expression. Surely, his very features changed their form; his jaw looked sometimes large and sometimes small; and the little ripple in his nose was a preparation for metamorphosis. When he turned his head quickly his hair seemed to shake out light, and some persons thought they saw decided genius in this coruscation.\\\" His grandmother, Mr. Casaubon's aunt, had been disinherited because she made a mesalliance, by marrying a poor Pole, and Mr. Casaubon, who feels an inherited responsibility for this, had educated Will. With artistic tastes, some ability as a writer, and a disregard for worldly considerations he has some difficulty in choosing a profession. When he meets Dorothea as Mr. Casaubon's wife he first becomes interested in her, and then grows to love her with constancy and devotion, and for the sake of being near her settles in Middlemarch as editor of Mr. Brooke's paper. His sense of honour causes him to refuse Mr. Bulstrode's offer of money, dishonestly gained, which should have been his mother's. When Dorothea, after a short widowhood, gives up position and fortune to marry him, he enters public life, without promise of marked success. It has been suggested that some traits in the character of Will Ladislaw were drawn, perhaps unconsciously, from George Henry Lewes, who, also, was a man of versatile talent and lively manner. Some critics, however, do not recognize Lewes as the original. Those who consider Lewes as the prototype find one of their arguments in the author's very evident fondness for the character of Ladislaw.

But he did not simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common. He was ambitious of a wider effect : he was fired with the possibility that he might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link in the chain of discovery . . . Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific, rational basis of his profession.\\\" He settles in Middlemarch, intending not only to be a good doctor, but also to carry on scientific investigation, for which he is well fitted. Captivated by Rosamond Vincy's beauty and grace, he marries her and soon discovers that she is absolutely selfish and unresponsive to his tender love, with no sympathy for his high aims. His opposition to accepted medical usages makes him unpopular with the other physicians of Middlemarch, and his connexion with Mr. Bulstrode leads him into trouble. His wife has only blame for him, and all his endeavours to economize are stubbornly opposed by her. The struggle between him and Rosamond, who demands position and luxury at any price, ends in the subjection of his higher self, and his noblest aims are sacrificed to worldly success. To meet the demands of her ambition he is forced to move to London, and become a fashionable physician, and dies there at a comparatively early age.

He had a large heap of short sermons, rather yellow and worn at the edges, from which he took two every Sunday, securing perfect impartiality in the selection by taking them as they came without reference to topics; and having preached one of these sermons at Shepperton in the morning, he mounted his horse and rode hastily with the other in his pocket to Knebley, where he officiated in a wonderful little church .... Here, in an absence of mind to which he was prone, Mr. Gillil would sometimes forget to take off his spurs before putting on his surplice, and only become aware of the omission by feeling something mysteriously tugging at the skirts of that garment as he stepped into the reading-desk.\\\" \\\"The dear old Vicar, though he had something of the knotted whimsical character of the poor lopped oak, had yet been sketched out by nature as a noble tree. The heart of him was sound, the grain was of the finest, and in the grey-haired man who filled his pocket with sugar-plums for the little children, whose most biting words were directed against the evil-doing of the rich man, and who, with all his social pipes and slipshod talk, never sank below the highest level of his parishioners' respect, there was the main trunk of the same brave, faithful, tender nature that had poured out the finest, freshest forces of its life-current in a first and only love\\u2014the love of Tina.\\\" All through his youth he loves the little Italian, Caterina, and tries to watch over her during her unhappy love affair with the worthless Captain Wybrow.

She has led secluded life, devoted entirely to her blind father, whose secretary she is. She falls in love with Tito Melema almost at first sight, gives him her entire\\ntrust as well as her love, and marries him, believing that he has the same high ideals as herself. Aside from her love for Tito, her devotion to her father is the strongest feeling in her life, and after his death she feels it a sacred obligation to carry out his wish to have his library preserved for the city of Florence. Although several things disturb her confidence in Tito, her eyes are not opened to his real character until he sells her father's library to the Duke of Milan in violation of what she considers a sacred trust. Believing that this shattering of her love releases her from her marriage vows, she decides to leave her husband, and is leaving Florence in disguise when she is stopped by Savonarola, who tells her that she can not thus break a sacred bond, and exhorts her to return and take up work for others if her personal happiness is gone. She yields to his influence, becomes one of his devoted followers, even though she does not accept all of his religious beliefs, and for several years spends herself in good works, staying with Tito, although their real separation in character and ideals becomes constantly more evident as Tito drifts from one treachery to another. When her godfather, Bernardo del Nero, is arrested, as she fears through Tito's treachery, and is executed in spite of her efforts to persuade Savonarola to save him, the limit of her endurance is  reached. Disappointed in Savonarola and grief-stricken at her godfather's death, she flees from Florence. By chance she reaches a plague-stricken village, and wins back peace and spiritual health by working among the sufferers. She returns to Florence just after Tito's death, and finds and cares for his two natural children and their mother. She is present at Savonarola's execution, and both then and during the rest of her life reveres him as a great religious leader who had helped her at a critical moment of her life. Romola, though nominally an Italian of the Renaissance, is so essentially an English Puritan that the suggestion has been made that some things in her character represent experiences of George Eliot's spiritual life. There is probably no ground for tracing a general resemblance, but in one respect, Romola's devotion to her father, there is, perhaps, a suggestion of a picture of George Eliot's affection for her father.\"}, {\"name\": \"Bartolommeo, Fra\", \"desc\": \"See Baccio.\"}, {\"name\": \"Beaucaire, Seneschal de (Hist.)\", \"desc\": \"Great favourite of the French king, for whom he purchases Bardo de' Bardi's art treasures.

And yet there was something fitful in the eyes, which contradicted the occasional flash of energy; after looking round with quick fierceness at windows and faces, they fell again with a lost and wandering look.\\\" A great scholar and of ample means, he had adopted Tito Melema as a child and had brough him up as his own son. While journeying to Delos he is captured by pirates, though Tito, who carries their fortune in gems, escapes. Carried into captivity, he believes that his son will find and ransom him, and succeeds in sending Tito word of his whereabouts. After desertion and illness have broken him down, he is sent back to Italy, and, as a prisoner of the French, is brought to Florence, where Tito has been prospering since their separation. Near the Duomo he escapes from his guards and runs into Tito, who knows him, but denies him. Brooding over this treachery, he attempts to kill Tito when they meet again, and later, when his mental powers have returned temporarily, makes charges against Tito at the great supper in the Rucellai Gardens, but is again denied by Tito and again breaks down, and is cast into prison, where he languishes for two years, until released during the famine.

If he were silent when his father expected some response, still he did not look moody; if he declined some labour--why he flung himself down with such a charming, half-smiling, halfpleading air, that the pleasure of looking at him made amends . . . the curves of Tito's mouth had ineffable good humour in them. And then, the quick talent to which everything came readily, from philosophical systems to the rhymes of a street ballad caught up at a hearing!\\\" \\\"[He] made almost every one fond of him, for he was young, and clever, and beautiful, and his manners to all were gentle and kind. I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of anything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as his own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds-such as make men infamous. He denied his father, and left him to misery; he betrayed every trust that was reposed in him, that he might keep himself safe and get rich and prosperous.\\\" He owes everything to his foster-father, Baldassarre CaJvo, who had brought him up as his own son. On a trip to Delos their boat was attacked by pirat.es and Baldassarre was captured, while Tito, who was carrying all their fortune in gems, escaped by swimming. In Florence, to which he makes his way after this misfortune, his brightness and charm\\nat once win him friends-Tessa, the contadina, shares her breakfast with him, and Nello, the barber, takes him under his protection and introduces him to the blind scholar, Bardo de' Bardi, through whose aid he succeeds in selling his gems and obtaining a post as professor of Greek. He acts as secretary to Bardo, winning both the confidence of the old scholar and the love of Bardo's beautiful daughter, Romola. Tito has allowed himself to keep up an acquaintance with Tessa, and eventually as a jest goes through a mock marriage with her. After selling his gems for a large sum he had made no attempt to use the money to find his father, persuading himself, instead, that the old man must be dead, and he even rejects a direct appeal for aid which the monk, Fra Luca, brings him from his father. His marriage to Romola is at first happy, but many things, especially his bad faith in selling her father's library, soon make her see that he is faithless and conscienceless, and they drift apart. When Baldassarre Calvo, as an escaped prisoner, comes upon Tito in Florence, Tito denies him and later even carries his treachery so far as to have Baldassarre imprisoned for two years. His tact and versatility have made him useful t.o many people, and he serves all three political parties at the same time, without any real loyalty to any, considering nothing but his own interest, working against Savonarola while pretending to be of his party, and even consenting to the death of Romola's godfather. He over-reaches himself, however, by arousing the resentment of Dolfo Spini whom he serves for his own ends, is attacked by Spini's followers, the Compagnacci, and, just as he succeeds in escaping from them, is found and killed by his deserted old father, the most sinned against of the many whom his selfishness has injured.\"}, {\"name\": \"Menico, Fra (Hist.)\", \"desc\": \"A monk who preaches against Savonarola.

In the act of bending, the cowl was pushed back, and the features of the monk had the full light of the tapers on them. They were very marked features, such as lend themselves to popular description. There was the high arched nose, the prominent under lip, the coronet of thick dark hair above the brow, all seeming to tell of energy and passion; there were the blue-grey eyes, shining mildly under auburn eyelashes, seeming, like the hands, to tell of acute sensitiveness.\\\" \\\"There was nothing transcendent in Savonarola's face.

Romola first sees him at her brother's death-bed, but his principal connexion with her is when he meets her, on her attempted flight from her husband, and influences her by his exhortations to return to Tito and take up work for others though her personal happiness is gone.

Note.\\u2014The plot of Silas Marner shows some marked resemblance to a Polish story by Kraszewski called Jermola the Potter.

Like Silas Marner, old Jermola finds a deserted infant near his hut, adopts it, and through love for it and the efforts which he has to make to support it, is restored to a happy and useful life.

Knowing that Fedalma is menaced by the Inquisition, he presses for an immediate marriage. When Fedalma, on learning that Zarca, the captured Gypsy chief, is her long-lost father casts in her lot with him and escapes with him from Bedmar, Duke Silva is broken-hearted. He follows Fedalma to the Gypsy camp, and when he cannot persuade her to return, elects to remain with her and become a Gypsy.

At the opening of the poem he is held prisoner by the Spaniards in Bedmar, where he sees the beautiful Fedalm.a, the Duke's betrothed, and recognizes her as his long lost daughter, who had been stolen in childhood by marauding Spaniards. Revealing himself to her, he sets before her the claims of her race and so works upon her with his force and eloquence that she agrees to leave Duke Silva, whom she loves devotedly, and to escape with her father and devote herself to the welfare of her race. After Duke Silva, unable to bear the loss of Fedalma, follows her to the Gypsy camp and for her sake joins the Gypsy band, deserting his post at Bedmar, Zarca, and his Moorish ally, El Zagal, attack and capture Bedmar. Zarca shows some moderation in his victory, although he condemns the inquisitor, Father Isidor, to death, and when Silva, frantic at Father Isidor's death and the thought that the loss of the town is due to his desertion of his post, stabs Zarca, the Gypsy protects him and will not allow his people to harm Silva. Dying, Zarca lays upon Fedalma the solemn duty of taking his place in the leadership of his people. Frederic Harrison has suggested that some traits in the character of Zarca were drawn from Dr. Richard Congreve, the Positivist leader. (See article in the Positivist Review, vol. 10, p. 160.)
