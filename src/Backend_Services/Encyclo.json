It is a beauty like that of kittens, or very small downy ducks making gentle rippling noises with their soft bills, or babies just beginning to toddle and to engage in conscious mischief--a beauty with which you can never be angry, but that you feel ready to crush for inability to comprehend the state of mind into which it throws you. Hetty Sorrel's was that sort of beauty.\" \"It is of little use for me to tell you that Hetty's cheek was like a rose--petal, that dimples played about her pouting lips, that her large dark eyes hid a soft roguishness under their long lashes, and that her curly hair, though all pushed back under her round cap while she was at work, stole back in dark delicate rings on her forehead, and about her white shelllike ears; it is of little use for me to say how lovely was the contour of her pink-and-white neckerchief, tucked into her low plum-coloured stuff boddice, or how the linen butter-making apron, with its bib, seemed a thing to be imitated in silk by duchesses, since it fell in such charming lines, or how her brown stockings and thick-soled buckled shoes lost all that clumsiness which they must certainly have had when empty of her foot and ankle; of little use, unless you have seen a woman who affected you as Hetty affected her beholders, for otherwise, though you might conjure up the image of a lovely woman, she would not in the least resemble that distracting kittenlike maiden ... Hetty's was a spring-tide beauty; it was the beauty of young frisking things, round-limbed, gambolling, circumventing you by a false air of innocence.\" Although she has been brought up by Mr. Poyser as if she had been his own daughter, she is incapable of feeling any gratitude and affection for him or his family. Her beauty attracts village suitors, including honest Adam Bede, whom her uncle favours, but she believes that her beauty destines her for a higher station. When she attracts the attention of the young squire, Arthur Donnithome, she sees a rosy future for herself, ignorantly thinking that his passion, to which she has secretly yielded, must end in marriage. When Arthur Donnithome breaks off his affair with her she is humiliated and sick at heart, but, later, seeing nothing better in the future, promises to marry Adam who is in ignorance of what her real relations with Arthur have been. As the time for their marriage approaches, Hetty realizes that the truth must soon come to light, and, under pretence of visiting Dinah Morris at Snowfield, journeys to Windsor to find Arthur Donnithome and then not finding him, journeys back in despair, lacking the courage to kill herself, but determined to keep her disgrace from her family. On her way back her baby is born. She leaves it in a wood to die, and is arrested for child-murder, tried and sentenced to death. Through her trial and sentence she maintains a hard, obstinate silence, which breaks down only when Dinah Morris goes to her in prison and spends the last night in her cell, pleading with her to confess. Dinah accompanies her to the place of execution, and at the last minute Hetty's sentence is commuted to transportation, from which she never returns. While Hetty herself is not a portrait, her tragedy, and, indeed, the germ of the plot of Adam Bede, were taken from a dramatic experience in the life of George Eliot's aunt, Elizabeth Evans (\"Dinah Morris\"). An ignorant girl, Mary Voce, had been tried at the Nottingham Assizes for child-murder, and had been sentenced to death. She had refused obstinately to confess her crime, and Mrs. Evans visited her in her cell, prayed over her all night, induced her to confess, and then rode with her to the place of execution and stayed with her until she was hanged.

The family likeness between her and her niece Dinah Morris, with the contrast between her keenness and Dinah's seraphic gentleness of expression, might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and Mary.

She keeps her eyes open for her neighbours' foibles and weaknesses, summing them up in keen, though homely, epigrams, and is strict with her husband's niece, Hetty Sorrel, whom she rightly suspects of selfishness and vanity. When the parsimonious Squire Donnithorne tries to impose upon her good-natured husband, Mrs. Poyser \"speaks her mind, to the Squire, routing him in a battle of words which delights the whole neighbourhood. In spite of her sharp tongue she is a kindly woman, much attached to her family and fond of her niece Dinah Morris, whose saintliness she appreciates though she does not approve of her Methodism and self-denial.

A writer in Notes and Queries, whose father had been clerk to William Evans, George Eliot's uncle, states that a Mrs. Poyser was Mr. William Evans' housekeeper, which might explain the use of the name.

She stood with her left hand towards the descending sun, and leafy boughs screened her from its rays; but in this sober light the delicate colouring of her face seemed to gather a calm vividness, like flowers at evening. It was a small oval face, of a uniform transparent whiteness, with an egg-like line of cheek and chin, a full but firm mouth, a delicate nostril, and a low perpendicular brow, burmounted by a rising arch of parting between smooth locks of pale reddish hair. The hair was drawn straight back behind the ears, and covered, except for an inch or two, above the brow, by a net Quaker cap. The eyebrows, of the same colour as the hair, were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled; the eyelashes, though no darker, were long and abundant; nothing was left blurred or unfinished. It was one of those faces that make one think of white flowers with light touches of colour on their pure petals. The eyes had no peculiar beauty, beyond that of expression; they looked so simple, so candid, so gravely loving, that no accusing scowl, no light sneer could help melting away before their glance.\" She lives at Snowfield, where she works in a mill, but at the opening of the story she is visiting her aunt at Hayslope, where she preaches movingly on the village Green. Seth Bede has long been in love with her, but Adam Bede has never seen her until, at the time of his father's death, she comes to his cottage to help his grief-stricken mother. Her sense of religious duty causes her to try to lead vain little Hetty Sorrel to a higher life, and while she produces no religious impression on Hetty, she leaves with her a sense of love which makes the girl turn to her later in her despair. Dinah is away from home when Hetty is tried for murder and sentenced to death, but she hurries to Hetty's prison as soon as the news reaches her, and there prays and talks with the stricken girl until she touches her heart and induces her to make the confession which she had obstinately refused to make. She goes with Hetty to the place of execution, and is with her when the reprieve arrives at the last minute. When his grief about Hetty has been somewhat softened, Adam Bede discovers that he is in love with Dinah, and eventually she marries him. The original of Dinah\nMorris was Elizabeth Evans, the wife of George Eliot's uncle, Samuel Evans, al though, as George Eliot herself says, the character is not an exact portrait. Mrs. Evans, whom George Eliot speaks of as \"my Methodist Aunt Samuel\", was an eloquent and well-known Wesleyan preacher, and some of her characteristics and experiences appear in Dinah Morris. One of Elizabeth Evans's striking experiences, when she induced an ignorant girl who had been convicted of child-murder to make a confession, and afterwards rode in the cart with her to the place of execution, gave George Eliot the idea for the climax of Adam Bede. Her connexion with Dinah Morris has been commemorated in the table erected to her memory in the Ebenezer Wesleyan Chapel in Wirksworth (\"Snowfield\") which reads \"Elizabeth Evans, known to the world as Dinah Bede\".

This gentle expression was the more interesting because the schoolmaster's nose, an irregular aquiline twisted a little on one side, had rather a formidable character ; and ids brow, more over, had that peculiar tension which always impresses one as a sign of a keen impatient temperament : the blue veins stood out like cords under the transparent yellow skin, and this intimidating brow was softened by no tendency to baldness, for the grey bristly hair, cut down to about an inch in length, stood round it in as close ranks as ever.\" He is a man of ability and education who has been made a crabbed woman-hater by some experience of his youth. He is at odds with Joshua Bann on the subject of church music, and often comments sharply on Hayslope doings and sayings.

The sleeve rolled up above the elbow showed an arm that was likely to win the prize for feats of strength ; yet the long supple hand, with its broad finger tips, looked ready for works of skill. In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon, and justified his name ; but the jetblack hair, made the more notice able by its contrast with the light paper cap, and the keen glance of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly marked, prominent and mobile eyebrows, indicated a mixture of Celtic blood. The face was large and roughly hewn, and when in repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an expression of good-humoured honest intelligence.\" Poverty and his father's bad habits had given him much to contend against, but with a strong will he had overcome obstacles, gained an education in Bartle Massey's night school, and made himself a capable artisan, respected by his neighbours for his ability and upright character.

When Adam finds that Arthur has been making love to Hetty, he fights Arthur, in spite of his strong affection for him, and forces him to break with Hetty, not knowing how far the relations between the two had gone.

When he learns that she has been arrested and is to be tried for child-murder Adam is overwhelmed with despair, and with rage against Arthur. He stands by Hetty in court, but is implacable against Arthur for a time, although later, won over by Arthur's genuine remorse, he consents to remain on the estate. Eventually he marries Dinah Morris. It is generally agreed that the character of Adam Bede and some of the incidents of hie career are drawn from Robert Evans, George Eliot's father.

Promising Mrs. Glasher not to marry Grandcourt, she goes away to escape his attentions, gambles at Leubronn, where she is influenced by seeing Daniel Deronda as she is losing, and is called home by the news that all her mother's property has been lost. As the only way of earning money herself which she can find is a hated position as governess, she marries Grandcourt in spite of her promise to Mrs. Glasher, attempting to quiet her conscience by the plea that she is doing it for her mother, to whom she is really attached. The false position in which she finds herself soon makes her unhappy, and she turns to Daniel Deronda, whose effect on her at Leubronn she has not forgotten, for spiritual aid, thereby arousing her husband's resentment and jealousy. Grandcourt's cruel and contemptuous attitude so arouses her hatred that she trifles with the idea that she could kill him, and when he is drowned before her eyes, she feels that her momentary delay in throwing him a rope makes her a murderess. In her remorse and despair she turns to Deronda as her only help, and from him gradually attains the beginning of a new spiritual attitude and unselfishness. When George Eliot was at Homburg in 1872 she was much impressed by a young lady whom she saw gambling there. This incident furnished the model for Gwendolen Harleth's gambling at Leubronn.

In a minor degree this is nothing un common, but in the Princess the acting had a rare perfection of physiognomy, voice, and gesture.\" Brought up by a stern and orthodox father who believed intensely in his race and in the inferiority of women, she had come to hate both his authority and the thought of being a Jewess. At her father's wish she had married her cousin Charisi, but had bent his gentle nature to her will and had gone on the stage, where her wonderful voice and acting made her the leading prima donna of her time. With all her ambition centred on a great career she had no love for her baby (Daniel), and after her husband's early death she persuaded Sir Hugo Mallinger, one of her admirers, to take Daniel to England and bring him up in ignorance of his birth. Some time after, thinking that her voice was failing, she married the Prince Halm-Eberstein and retired from the stage. Believing that she had done the best thing for Daniel in having him brought up as a Christian Englishman, she had never intended to reveal herself to him, but when suffering from an incurable disease she becomes conscience stricken at the thought that she has thwarted her father's desire to have a grandson, and summons Deronda to meet her at Genoa, where she makes her self and his race known to him without responding in any way to the affection which he offers her. In his Life and Writings of Isaac Disraeli, by his Son, Benjamin Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield, gives an account of Isaac Disraeli's mother, which in some respects, particularly her intense resentment of her race and its social disadvantages and her lack of affection for her son, so resembles the Princess Halm-Eberstein, that it seems probable that George Eliot must have taken some touches in the portrait of Deronda's mother, and in the scene be tween mother and son, from this original.

For a while he feels as much liking for her as his worn-out nature permits, but her attitude toward Deronda, innocent though it is, arouses his jealousy and he determines to break her spirit and bend her to his idea of what his wife should be, heedless of the hatred which this arouses in her.

He is sensitive about his ignorance of his parentage, though much attached to Sir Hugo whom he believes to be his father, and his equivocal position makes him restless and unsettled. At the opening of the story he sees Gwendolen Harleth gambling at Leubronn, and his disapproval disturbs her then and influences her later, when, after her return to England, she marries Grandcourt, Sir Hugo's nephew, and she and Deronda are thus thrown together in the same social circle. While rowing on the Thames Deronda saves Mirah Cohen, a beautiful Jewess who is attempting suicide, finding a refuge for her with his friends the Meyricks and continuing to watch over her. In his efforts to trace Mirah's lost brother, Ezra, he forms a strong friendship with Mordecai Cohen, becomes interested in Jewish questions through him, and eventually discovers that Mordecai is Mirah's brother Ezra and falls in love with Mirah. Meanwhile he feels a different kind of interest in Gwendolen who, in the unhappiness of her marriage, appeals to him for advice and guidance. When his acquaintance with Mordecai and Mirah has thoroughly aroused his interest in the Jews, he is summoned to Genoa to meet his hitherto unknown mother, the Princess Halm-Eberstein, learns from her that he is a Jew, and rejoices in the information. While he is still at Genoa, Grandcourt is drowned in the Mediterranean, and Deronda supports Gwendolen in her remorse and despair, and later she turns to him as her one source of help. On his return to England he devotes himself to work for the Jews, marries Mirah, and with her goes to Palestine to try to realize Mordecai's dream of a revival of Jewish nationalism. According to Sir Leslie Stephen, Edmund Gurney (1847-1888) may have been, in sorne respects at least, the original of Daniel Deronda.

It was a finely typical Jewish face, wrought into intensity of expression apparently by a strenuous eager experience in which all the satisfaction had been indirect and far off, and perhaps by some bodily suffering also, which involved that absence of ease in the present. The feature were clear-cut, not large; the brow not high, but broad, and fully defined by the crisp black hair. It might never have been a particularly handsome face, but it must always have been forcible.\" \"A man steeped in poverty and obscurity, weakened by disease, consciously within the shadow of advancing death, but living an intense life in an invisible past and future, careless of his personal lot, except for its possibly making some obstruction to a conceived good which he would never share except as a brief inward vision--a day afar off, whose sun would never warm him, but into which he threw his sou's desire, with a passion often wanting to the personal motives of healthy youth.\" His whole life is wrapped up in his belief in the regeneration of a great Jewish nationality in Palestine if only the right leader of the race can be found. As a young man he had started east to work in Palestine, when he was recalled because his mother needed his help after her husband had deserted her. The need of caring for his mother and the consumption which he develops from exposure make him give up the idea of his own leadership, and when Daniel Deronda meets him he is living in semi-poverty as a watch mender in the Cohen pawnshop and an off-hour attendant in Mr. Ram's book shop, constantly hoping to find the leader on whom his mantle can descend. He sees in Deronda this destined leader, introduces Deronda to the Philosphers' Club at the \"Hand and Banner\", and rouses his keen interest both in the Jewish race and in the thought that he may be a Jew himself. Throught Deronda's instrumentality, his relationship to Mirah is discovered, and after Deronda and Mirah are married he dies happy in the belief that they will realize his dream.

Lewes frequented in his youth, and which he describes in the Fortnightly Review, vol. 4, p. 386. To the personal characteristics of this Cohn, as Lewes described him, George Eliot added the belief in a renewed Jewish nationality, which she is said to have taken from a Moldavian Jew possessed of the same idea whom she met in Munich.

At the first glance, every one thought him a very odd-looking rusty old man; the free-school boys often hooted after him and called him \"Revelations\"; and to many respectable church people old Lyon's little legs and large head seemed to make Dissent additionally preposterous. But he was too shortsighted to notice those who tittered at him-too absent from the world of small facts and petty impulses in which titterers live.\" \"Once in his life he had been blinded, deafened, hurried along by rebellious impulse ; he had gone astray after his own desires, and had let the fire die out on the altar ; and as the true penitent, hating his self-besotted error, asks from all coming life duty instead of joy, and service instead of ease, so Rufus was perpetually on the watch lest he should ever again postpone to some private affection a great public opportunity which to him was equivalent to a command.\" Twenty-two years before the opening of the story Rufus Lyon was an eloquent and successful minister of a large Independent Chapel, when Annette Ledru came suddenly into his life. The death of her husband, Maurice Christian Bycliffe, had left her penniless in a strange land, and Mr. Lyon took her and her baby into his home, in spite of the criticism of his congregation, fell deeply in love with her, and gave up his high calling to watch over her and her child. After a time the grateful Annette married him and when she died, three years later, he returned to the ministry, and brought up the baby, Esther, as his own daughter. At the opening of the story he is leading, in humble surroundings, a life of wrapt absorption in his work and loving devotion to Esther, who still believes herself his daughter. When events make him believe that she should no longer be kept in ignorance of her parentage he tells her the full story and leaves her free to decide whether or not she will claim the inheritance and rank to which she is apparently entitled. The original of Rufus Lyon was the Reverend Francis Franklin, a Baptist minister, who for fifty-four years, from 1799 until his death in 1852, was pastor of the Cow Lane Chapel, in Coventry. Mr. Franklin was the father of the Misses Franklin, whose school in Coventry George Eliot attended, and the character of Rufus Lyon is said by those who remembered him, to be a faithful portrait.

Esther had that excellent thing in woman, a soft voice with a clear fluent utterance. Her sauciness was always charming, because it was without emphasis, and was accompanied with graceful little turns of the head.\" \"She had one of those exceptional organizations which are quick and sensitive without being in the least morbid ; she was alive to the finest shades of manner, to the nicest distinctions of tone and accent . . . Her own pretty instep, clad in a silk stocking, her little heel, just rising from a kid slipper, her irreproachable nails and delicate wrist, were the objects of delighted consciousness to her; and she felt that it was her superiority which made her unable to use without disgust any but the finest cambric handkerchiefs and freshest gloves. Her money all went in the gratification of these nice tastes, and she saved nothing from her earnings . . . she hated all meanness, would empty her purse impulsively on some sudden appeal to her pity, and if she found out that her father had a want she would supply it with some pretty device of a surprise.\" She had been brought up as the daughter of Rufus Lyon, the Independent minister, and while fond of her father has little sympathy with his simple tastes and life. Through her father she meets Felix Holt. and while at first repelled by his surface roughness, soon becomes interested in him and in the lectures that he gives her. Fearing that she may hear the story from someone else, Rufus Lyon tells her that he is not her real father, and that she is the daughter of Maurice Christian Bycliffe. She is much touched by his story of his devotion and marriage to her mother, and gains a different appreciation of his life and character. Later, after she learns that she is the rightful owner of the Transome estates, she goes to Transome Court to visit Mrs. Transome, and there is courted by Harold Transome. What she sees at Transome Court shows her that wealth does not necessarily bring happiness, and as Felix Holt's trial for manslaughter has opened her eyes to the strength of her real feeling for him, she gives up her claim to the estate to marry Felix. While George Eliot's portrait of Esther Lyon is not autobiographic to anything like the same extent as that of the character of Maggie Tulliver (in Mill on the Floss), there are some things in it--the fastidiousness, niceness about dress, etc.-for which the author's own tastes and habits supplied the original.

But he did not simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common.

Captivated by Rosamond Vincy's beauty and grace, he marries her and soon discovers that she is absolutely selfish and unresponsive to his tender love, with no sympathy for his high aims. His opposition to accepted medical usages makes him unpopular with the other physicians of Middlemarch, and his connexion with Mr. Bulstrode leads him into trouble. His wife has only blame for him, and all his endeavours to economize are stubbornly opposed by her.

The first impression on seeing Will was one of sunny brightness, which added to the uncertainty of his changing expression. Surely, his very features changed their form; his jaw looked sometimes large and sometimes small; and the little ripple in his nose was a preparation for metamorphosis. When he turned his head quickly his hair seemed to shake out light, and some persons thought they saw decided genius in this coruscation.\" His grandmother, Mr. Casaubon's aunt, had been disinherited because she made a mesalliance, by marrying a poor Pole, and Mr. Casaubon, who feels an inherited responsibility for this, had educated Will. With artistic tastes, some ability as a writer, and a disregard for worldly considerations he has some difficulty in choosing a profession. When he meets Dorothea as Mr. Casaubon's wife he first becomes interested in her, and then grows to love her with constancy and devotion, and for the sake of being near her settles in Middlemarch as editor of Mr. Brooke's paper. His sense of honour causes him to refuse Mr. Bulstrode's offer of money, dishonestly gained, which should have been his mother's. When Dorothea, after a short widowhood, gives up position and fortune to marry him, he enters public life, without promise of marked success. It has been suggested that some traits in the character of Will Ladislaw were drawn, perhaps unconsciously, from George Henry Lewes, who, also, was a man of versatile talent and lively manner. Some critics, however, do not recognize Lewes as the original. Those who consider Lewes as the prototype find one of their arguments in the author's very evident fondness for the character of Ladislaw.

She was usually spoken of as being remakably clever, but with the addition that sister Celia had more common-sense.\" \"She came into the drawing room in her silver-grey dress--the simple lines of her dark brown hair parted over her brown and coiled massively behind, in keeping with the entire absence from her manner and expression of all searc after mere effect.

She soon realizes that she has idealized her husband, who is a cold, jealous, and selfish man, engaged in a work of no real value.

Nothing could be more delicate than the blond complexion\u2014its bloom set off by the powdered hair\u2014than the veined overhanging eyelids, which gave an indolent expression to the hazel eyes ; nothing more finely cut than the transparent nostril and the short upper-lip. Perhaps the chin nd lower jaw were too small for an irreproachable profile, but the defect was on the side of that delicacy and finesse which was the distinctive characteristic of the whole person, and which was carried out in the clear brown arch of the eyebrows, and the marble smoothness of the sloping forehead.\" He deliberately wins the love of Caterina, his uncle's penniless protegee, without intending to marry her. In response to his uncle's wishes he becomes engaged to the beauty, Miss Assher, and gives no thought to the suffering he causes Caterina. When her jealousy annoys him, his weak heart causes his death. Charles Parker, nephew and heir of Sir Roger Newdigate (\"Sir Christopher Cheverel\") was, in the matter of his personal appearance, his relation to a rich and childless uncle and his sudden death, the original of Captain Wybrow. Captain Wybrow's love affair with Caterina is purely fictitious, however, as Sally Shilton (\"Caterina\") was only a child at the time of Charles Parker's marriage to Miss Anstruther (\"Miss Assher\").

If he were silent when his father expected some response, still he did not look moody; if he declined some labour--why he flung himself down with such a charming, half-smiling, halfpleading air, that the pleasure of looking at him made amends . . . the curves of Tito's mouth had ineffable good humour in them. And then, the quick talent to which everything came readily, from philosophical systems to the rhymes of a street ballad caught up at a hearing!\" \"[He] made almost every one fond of him, for he was young, and clever, and beautiful, and his manners to all were gentle and kind. I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of anything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as his own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds-such as make men infamous. He denied his father, and left him to misery; he betrayed every trust that was reposed in him, that he might keep himself safe and get rich and prosperous.\" He owes everything to his foster-father, Baldassarre CaJvo, who had brought him up as his own son. On a trip to Delos their boat was attacked by pirat.es and Baldassarre was captured, while Tito, who was carrying all their fortune in gems, escaped by swimming. In Florence, to which he makes his way after this misfortune, his brightness and charm\nat once win him friends-Tessa, the contadina, shares her breakfast with him, and Nello, the barber, takes him under his protection and introduces him to the blind scholar, Bardo de' Bardi, through whose aid he succeeds in selling his gems and obtaining a post as professor of Greek. He acts as secretary to Bardo, winning both the confidence of the old scholar and the love of Bardo's beautiful daughter, Romola. Tito has allowed himself to keep up an acquaintance with Tessa, and eventually as a jest goes through a mock marriage with her. After selling his gems for a large sum he had made no attempt to use the money to find his father, persuading himself, instead, that the old man must be dead, and he even rejects a direct appeal for aid which the monk, Fra Luca, brings him from his father. His marriage to Romola is at first happy, but many things, especially his bad faith in selling her father's library, soon make her see that he is faithless and conscienceless, and they drift apart. When Baldassarre Calvo, as an escaped prisoner, comes upon Tito in Florence, Tito denies him and later even carries his treachery so far as to have Baldassarre imprisoned for two years. His tact and versatility have made him useful t.o many people, and he serves all three political parties at the same time, without any real loyalty to any, considering nothing but his own interest, working against Savonarola while pretending to be of his party, and even consenting to the death of Romola's godfather. He over-reaches himself, however, by arousing the resentment of Dolfo Spini whom he serves for his own ends, is attacked by Spini's followers, the Compagnacci, and, just as he succeeds in escaping from them, is found and killed by his deserted old father, the most sinned against of the many whom his selfishness has injured.", "Data": {"Relation": "Melema, Tito"}}, {"Title": "Manetti, Sibilla", "desc": "The old woman with whom Tessa and her children are stranded after Tito's death.", "Data": {"Relation": "Manetti, Sibilla"}}, {"Title": "Luca, Fra", "desc": "The religious name of Romola's brother Bernardino de' Bardi, who has left his family to become a Dominican monk.

On his way home, broken in health, he meets aman who has seen Baldassarre Calvo, Tito Melema's deserted father, and from him receives a letter to Tito begging him to save his father from slavery. He delivers the note, and is thus the one person who knows that Tito is aware that his father is alive. Although he has this knowledge, which might have saved his sister Romola from her disastrous marriage to Tito Melema, he does not warn her of it, but instead, when dying, gives her a visionary, mystical warning which merely distresses her.

His beard which had grown long in neglect, and the hair which fell thick and straight round his baldness, were nearly white. His thickset figure was still firm and upright, though emaciated, and seemed to express energy in spite of age--and exptression that was partly carried out in the dark eyes and strong dark eyebrows, which had a strangely isolated intensity of colour in the midst of his yellow, bloodless, deep-wrinkled face with its lank grey hairs. And yet there was something fitful in the eyes, which contradicted the occasional flash of energy; after looking round with quick fierceness at windows and faces, they fell again with a lost and wandering look.\" A great scholar and of ample means, he had adopted Tito Melema as a child and had brough him up as his own son. While journeying to Delos he is captured by pirates, though Tito, who carries their fortune in gems, escapes. Carried into captivity, he believes that his son will find and ransom him, and succeeds in sending Tito word of his whereabouts. After desertion and illness have broken him down, he is sent back to Italy, and, as a prisoner of the French, is brought to Florence, where Tito has been prospering since their separation. Near the Duomo he escapes from his guards and runs into Tito, who knows him, but denies him. Brooding over this treachery, he attempts to kill Tito when they meet again, and later, when his mental powers have returned temporarily, makes charges against Tito at the great supper in the Rucellai Gardens, but is again denied by Tito and again breaks down, and is cast into prison, where he languishes for two years, until released during the famine. Romola succours him and he seeks to enlist her aid against Tito, by telling her of Tito's \"other wife\", Tessa. Reduced to a pitiable condition by mental and physical suffering and forced to beg, he is kept alive only by the hope of vengeance. Eventually he finds Tito again, when the latter, worn out by his long swim to escape the mob, is cast ashore on the river bank, and he strangles Tito, dying himself immediately after. While Baldassarre Calvo is a fictitious character, there is an historical original for one of the events of his career. Villari, in his Life of Savonarola, tells of the escape of three prisoners at the time of the French entry into Florence who were liberated by the crowd just as in Romola. As this is the only printed source for this story, George Eliot undoubtedly took this incident from Villari, as Guido Biagi points out. (See Villari, Savonarola, p. 231; also Biagi edition of Romola.

She has led secluded life, devoted entirely to her blind father, whose secretary she is. She falls in love with Tito Melema almost at first sight, gives him her entire\ntrust as well as her love, and marries him, believing that he has the same high ideals as herself. Aside from her love for Tito, her devotion to her father is the strongest feeling in her life, and after his death she feels it a sacred obligation to carry out his wish to have his library preserved for the city of Florence. Although several things disturb her confidence in Tito, her eyes are not opened to his real character until he sells her father's library to the Duke of Milan in violation of what she considers a sacred trust. Believing that this shattering of her love releases her from her marriage vows, she decides to leave her husband, and is leaving Florence in disguise when she is stopped by Savonarola, who tells her that she can not thus break a sacred bond, and exhorts her to return and take up work for others if her personal happiness is gone. She yields to his influence, becomes one of his devoted followers, even though she does not accept all of his religious beliefs, and for several years spends herself in good works, staying with Tito, although their real separation in character and ideals becomes constantly more evident as Tito drifts from one treachery to another. When her godfather, Bernardo del Nero, is arrested, as she fears through Tito's treachery, and is executed in spite of her efforts to persuade Savonarola to save him, the limit of her endurance is  reached. Disappointed in Savonarola and grief-stricken at her godfather's death, she flees from Florence. By chance she reaches a plague-stricken village, and wins back peace and spiritual health by working among the sufferers. She returns to Florence just after Tito's death, and finds and cares for his two natural children and their mother.

Ch. ii. \"Yet few men could be more harmless than poor Marner. In his truthful simple soul, not even the growing greed and worship of gold could beget any vice directly injurious to others. The light of his faith quite put out, and his affections made desolate, he had clung with all the force of his nature to his work and his money; and like all objects to which a man devotes himself, they had fashioned him into correspondence with themselves. His loom, as he wrought in it without ceasing, had in its turn wrought on him, and confirmed more and more the monotonous craving for its monotonous response. His gold, as he hung over it and saw it grow, gathered his power of loving together into a hard isolation like its own.\" In his youth he had been an artisan in a large manufacturing town where, in spite of the fact that he was subject to occasional cataleptic attacks, he led a contented life, his strong interests being his membership in a dissenting church, his friendship for William Dane, and his approaching marriage. Falsely accused of a robbery through his friend's treachery, and driven from church and home, he had wandered to Raveloe where he settled. With all faith in both men and religion lost through his cruel experience, he leads there a lonely life as a recluse and miser, his one pleasure the contemplation of the growing hoard of gold which he saves slowly by hard and constant toil. When his money is stolen, and the little golden-haired Eppie, an unclaimed child, comes, as he thinks, in place of the gold, he brings her up as his daughter, and through her needs and affection regains his joy in life. Note.\u2014The plot of Silas Marner shows some marked resemblance to a Polish story by Kraszewski called Jermola the Potter. The similarity is most striking in the case of the central figure, Jermola, a deserted lonely old man left in poverty by the well-to-do family to which he had given a lifetime of service. Like Silas Marner, old Jermola finds a deserted infant near his hut, adopts it, and through love for it and the efforts which he has to make to support it, is restored to a happy and useful life.

A man of lofty and resolute purpose, capable of putting the claims of his people ahead of all personal considerations, he aspires to fuse together the scattered bands of Gypsies in Spain and lead them to found a Gypsy nation in Africa. At the opening of the poem he is held prisoner by the Spaniards in Bedmar, where he sees the beautiful Fedalm.a, the Duke's betrothed, and recognizes her as his long lost daughter, who had been stolen in childhood by marauding Spaniards. Revealing himself to her, he sets before her the claims of her race and so works upon her with his force and eloquence that she agrees to leave Duke Silva, whom she loves devotedly, and to escape with her father and devote herself to the welfare of her race. After Duke Silva, unable to bear the loss of Fedalma, follows her to the Gypsy camp and for her sake joins the Gypsy band, deserting his post at Bedmar, Zarca, and his Moorish ally, El Zagal, attack and capture Bedmar. Zarca shows some moderation in his victory, although he condemns the inquisitor, Father Isidor, to death, and when Silva, frantic at Father Isidor's death and the thought that the loss of the town is due to his desertion of his post, stabs Zarca, the Gypsy protects him and will not allow his people to harm Silva. Dying, Zarca lays upon Fedalma the solemn duty of taking his place in the leadership of his people. Frederic Harrison has suggested that some traits in the character of Zarca were drawn from Dr. Richard Congreve, the Positivist leader. (See article in the Positivist Review, vol. 10, p. 160.)
