""There is one order of beauty which seems made to turn the heads not only of men, but of all intelligent mammals, even of women. It is a beauty like that of kittens, or very small downy ducks making gentle rippling noises with their soft bills, or babies just beginning to toddle and to engage in conscious mischief--a beauty with which you can never be angry, but that you feel ready to crush for inability to comprehend the state of mind into which it throws you. Hetty Sorrel's was that sort of beauty."" ""It is of little use for me to tell you that Hetty's cheek was like a rose--petal, that dimples played about her pouting lips, that her large dark eyes hid a soft roguishness under their long lashes, and that her curly hair, though all pushed back under her round cap while she was at work, stole back in dark delicate rings on her forehead, and about her white shelllike ears; it is of little use for me to say how lovely was the contour of her pink-and-white neckerchief, tucked into her low plum-coloured stuff boddice, or how the linen butter-making apron, with its bib, seemed a thing to be imitated in silk by duchesses, since it fell in such charming lines, or how her brown stockings and thick-soled buckled shoes lost all that clumsiness which they must certainly have had when empty of her foot and ankle; of little use, unless you have seen a woman who affected you as Hetty affected her beholders, for otherwise, though you might conjure up the image of a lovely woman, she would not in the least resemble that distracting kittenlike maiden ... Hetty's was a spring-tide beauty; it was the beauty of young frisking things, round-limbed, gambolling, circumventing you by a false air of innocence."" Although she has been brought up by Mr. Poyser as if she had been his own daughter, she is incapable of feeling any gratitude and affection for him or his family. Her beauty attracts village suitors, including honest Adam Bede, whom her uncle favours, but she believes that her beauty destines her for a higher station. When she attracts the attention of the young squire, Arthur Donnithome, she sees a rosy future for herself, ignorantly thinking that his passion, to which she has secretly yielded, must end in marriage. When Arthur Donnithome breaks off his affair with her she is humiliated and sick at heart, but, later, seeing nothing better in the future, promises to marry Adam who is in ignorance of what her real relations with Arthur have been. As the time for their marriage approaches, Hetty realizes that the truth must soon come to light, and, under pretence of visiting Dinah Morris at Snowfield, journeys to Windsor to find Arthur Donnithome and then not finding him, journeys back in despair, lacking the courage to kill herself, but determined to keep her disgrace from her family. On her way back her baby is born. She leaves it in a wood to die, and is arrested for child-murder, tried and sentenced to death. Through her trial and sentence she maintains a hard, obstinate silence, which breaks down only when Dinah Morris goes to her in prison and spends the last night in her cell, pleading with her to confess. Dinah accompanies her to the place of execution, and at the last minute Hetty's sentence is commuted to transportation, from which she never returns. While Hetty herself is not a portrait, her tragedy, and, indeed, the germ of the plot of Adam Bede, were taken from a dramatic experience in the life of George Eliot's aunt, Elizabeth Evans (""Dinah Morris""). An ignorant girl, Mary Voce, had been tried at the Nottingham Assizes for child-murder, and had been sentenced to death. She had refused obstinately to confess her crime, and Mrs. Evans visited her in her cell, prayed over her all night, induced her to confess, and then rode with her to the place of execution and stayed with her until she was hanged.

""Where that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from, remained a mystery even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all, he got it chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into this honest conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other narrow souls before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice and a musical ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the responses. The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance, like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the wind among the autumn boughs.""

"" Do not suppose, however, that Mrs. Poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance; ahe was a good-looking woman, not more than eight-and-thirty, of fair complexion and sandy hair, well-shapen, light-footed: the most conspicuous article in her attire was an ample checkered linen apron, which almost covered her skirt; and nothing could be plainer or less noticeable than her cap and gown, for there was no weakness of which she was less tolerant than feminine vanity, and the preference of ornament to utility. The family likeness between her and her niece Dinah Morris, with the contrast between her keenness and Dinah's seraphic gentleness of expression, might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and Mary. Their eyes were just of the same colour, but a striking test of the difference in their operation was seen in the
demeanour of Trip, the black--andtan terrier, whenever that muchsuspected dog unwarily exposed himself to the freezing arctic ray of Mrs. Poyser's glance. Her tongue was not lees keen than her eye, and, whenever a damsel came within earshot, seemed to take up an unfinished lecture, as a barrel-organ takes up a tune, precisely at the point where it had left off."" ""She has the spirit of three men, with that pale face of hers; and she says such sharp things, too."" ""Sharp I yes, her tongue is like a new-set razor. She's quite original in her talk, too; one of those untaught wits that help to stock a country with proverbs. I told you that capital thing I heard her say about Craig--that he was like a cock who thought the sun had risen to hear him crow. Now that's an Aesop's fable in a sentence."" She is a pattern dairywoman and housekeeper, with standards of excellence which none of her much-berated maids, even under the spur of her sharp tongue, ever succeeds in living up to. She keeps her eyes open for her neighbours' foibles and weaknesses, summing them up in keen, though homely, epigrams, and is strict with her husband's niece, Hetty Sorrel, whom she rightly suspects of selfishness and vanity. When the parsimonious Squire Donnithorne tries to impose upon her good-natured husband, Mrs. Poyser ""speaks her mind, to the Squire, routing him in a battle of words which delights the whole neighbourhood. In spite of her sharp tongue she is a kindly woman, much attached to her family and fond of her niece Dinah Morris, whose saintliness she appreciates though she does not approve of her Methodism and self-denial. For several of Mrs. Poyser's traits—her kindliness, shrewd common sense, and witty tongue —George Eliot's own mother, Mrs. Robert Evans (Christiana Pearson) was the original. Mr. John W. Cross, in George Eliot's Life, describes Mrs. Robert Evans as a ""woman with an unusual amount of force—a shrewd practical person, with a considerable dash of the Mrs. Poyser vein in her."" Cross, vol. 1, p. 13. The name Poyser was a real name in the neighbourhood of Ellastone (the ""Hayslope"" of Adam Bede), and an actual Mrs. Poyser, a farmer's wife, is said to have lived there at the time when George Eliot's father, Robert Evans, was still in Ellastone. A writer in Notes and Queries, whose father had been clerk to William Evans, George Eliot's uncle, states that a Mrs. Poyser was Mr. William Evans' housekeeper, which might explain the use of the name.

""Like all old men whose life has been spent in labour, he liked to feel that he was still useful—that there was a better crop of onions in the garden because he was by at the sowing—and that the cows would be milked the better if he stayed at home on a Sunday afternoon to look on.

Mr. Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg, and suspected that the growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs, had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human calf.

""She stood and turned her grey eyes on the people. There was no keenness in the eyes; they seemed rather to be shedding love than making observations; they had the liquid look which tells that the mind is full of what it has to give out, rather than impressed by external objects. She stood with her left hand towards the descending sun, and leafy boughs screened her from its rays; but in this sober light the delicate colouring of her face seemed to gather a calm vividness, like flowers at evening. It was a small oval face, of a uniform transparent whiteness, with an egg-like line of cheek and chin, a full but firm mouth, a delicate nostril, and a low perpendicular brow, burmounted by a rising arch of parting between smooth locks of pale reddish hair. The hair was drawn straight back behind the ears, and covered, except for an inch or two, above the brow, by a net Quaker cap. The eyebrows, of the same colour as the hair, were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled; the eyelashes, though no darker, were long and abundant; nothing was left blurred or unfinished. It was one of those faces that make one think of white flowers with light touches of colour on their pure petals. The eyes had no peculiar beauty, beyond that of expression; they looked so simple, so candid, so gravely loving, that no accusing scowl, no light sneer could help melting away before their glance."" She lives at Snowfield, where she works in a mill, but at the opening of the story she is visiting her aunt at Hayslope, where she preaches movingly on the village Green. Seth Bede has long been in love with her, but Adam Bede has never seen her until, at the time of his father's death, she comes to his cottage to help his grief-stricken mother. Her sense of religious duty causes her to try to lead vain little Hetty Sorrel to a higher life, and while she produces no religious impression on Hetty, she leaves with her a sense of love which makes the girl turn to her later in her despair. Dinah is away from home when Hetty is tried for murder and sentenced to death, but she hurries to Hetty's prison as soon as the news reaches her, and there prays and talks with the stricken girl until she touches her heart and induces her to make the confession which she had obstinately refused to make. She goes with Hetty to the place of execution, and is with her when the reprieve arrives at the last minute. When his grief about Hetty has been somewhat softened, Adam Bede discovers that he is in love with Dinah, and eventually she marries him. The original of Dinah
Morris was Elizabeth Evans, the wife of George Eliot's uncle, Samuel Evans, al though, as George Eliot herself says, the character is not an exact portrait. Mrs. Evans, whom George Eliot speaks of as ""my Methodist Aunt Samuel"", was an eloquent and well-known Wesleyan preacher, and some of her characteristics and experiences appear in Dinah Morris. One of Elizabeth Evans's striking experiences, when she induced an ignorant girl who had been convicted of child-murder to make a confession, and afterwards rode in the cart with her to the place of execution, gave George Eliot the idea for the climax of Adam Bede. Her connexion with Dinah Morris has been commemorated in the table erected to her memory in the Ebenezer Wesleyan Chapel in Wirksworth (""Snowfield"") which reads ""Elizabeth Evans, known to the world as Dinah Bede"".

""The face wore its mildest expression: the grizzled bushy eyebrows had taken their more acute angle of compassionate kindness, and the mouth, habitually compressed with a pout of the lower lip, was relaxed so as to be ready to speak a helpful word or syllable in a moment. This gentle expression was the more interesting because the schoolmaster's nose, an irregular aquiline twisted a little on one side, had rather a formidable character ; and ids brow, more over, had that peculiar tension which always impresses one as a sign of a keen impatient temperament : the blue veins stood out like cords under the transparent yellow skin, and this intimidating brow was softened by no tendency to baldness, for the grey bristly hair, cut down to about an inch in length, stood round it in as close ranks as ever."" He is a man of ability and education who has been made a crabbed woman-hater by some experience of his youth. He is at odds with Joshua Bann on the subject of church music, and often comments sharply on Hayslope doings and sayings. To Adam Bede, who had been a pupil in his night-school, Bartle Massey is a loyal friend, giving up all of his own interests to go to Stoniton to stay with Adam during Hetty Sorrel's trial. Bartle Massey is one of the real named used by George Eliot in Adam Bede. The master of the school which her father, Robert Evans (""Adam Bede "") attended near Roston, was named Bartle Massey, and, according to the account of him given by Mottram, had some of the characteristics of the Bartle Massey of the story.

As a boy he was much attached to Adam Bede, and this friendship continues after Arthur is grown up, causing him to plan the many things which he will do for Adam when he inherits the estate. At the opening of the story he is invalided home from his regiment with a broken arm, and beguiles the tedium of his inaction by noticing pretty Hetty Sorrel, not knowing that Adam Bede is courting her. Finding that her attraction is becoming too strong, he resolves to break away, but cannot keep his good resolution and ends by really falling in love with her, without any idea on his part of marriage, although Hetty believes that he will marry her. When Adam finds Hetty and Arthur together, he and Arthur fight, and the latter, forced to it by Adam who does not know how far things have gone, writes a letter to Hetty breaking off their relationship, but telling her how to reach him if she needs him, and then joins his regiment. When he learns that Adam and Hetty are to be married he is relieved that the affair has ended so well, and salves his conscience with the thought of the kind things that he means to do for them. His remorse is great when, called home by his grandfather's death, he learns that Hetty is being tried on the charge of murdering his child and hers.

The sleeve rolled up above the elbow showed an arm that was likely to win the prize for feats of strength ; yet the long supple hand, with its broad finger tips, looked ready for works of skill. In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon, and justified his name ; but the jetblack hair, made the more notice able by its contrast with the light paper cap, and the keen glance of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly marked, prominent and mobile eyebrows, indicated a mixture of Celtic blood. The face was large and roughly hewn, and when in repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an expression of good-humoured honest intelligence."" Poverty and his father's bad habits had given him much to contend against, but with a strong will he had overcome obstacles, gained an education in Bartle Massey's night school, and made himself a capable artisan, respected by his neighbours for his ability and upright character. At the beginning of the story he is chief workman in Jonathan Burge'a timber yard, with proapects of a partnership eome day, especially if he is willing to marry gentle Mary Burge. He has ideas about timber, and his friend Arthur Donnithome , the heir of the manor, for whom Adam entertains a strong friendship dating from their boyhood, intends to put Adam in charge of the Donnithome woods whenever the old aquire dies. He ie deeply in love with shallow Hetty Sorrel, the village beauty, who, however, ignores him, aa her head has been turned by attentions from Arthur Donnithome. When Adam finds that Arthur has been making love to Hetty, he fights Arthur, in spite of his strong affection for him, and forces him to break with Hetty, not knowing how far the relations between the two had gone. Later Adam becomes engaged to Hetty, but she runs away just before the date set for the wedding. When he learns that she has been arrested and is to be tried for child-murder Adam is overwhelmed with despair, and with rage against Arthur. He stands by Hetty in court, but is implacable against Arthur for a time, although later, won over by Arthur's genuine remorse, he consents to remain on the estate. Eventually he marries Dinah Morris. It is generally agreed that the character of Adam Bede and some of the incidents of hie career are drawn from Robert Evans, George Eliot's father.

George Eliot's use of dialect is both accurate and artistic. While all dialect words and phrases used are scrupulously correct, they are introduced only in so far as is needed to give the right local colour, and not in such numbers as to affect the intelligibility for the ordinary reader. The dialects used in the various novels are: Adam Bede, the dialect of North Staffordshire and the neighbouring part of Derbyshire; Scenes of Clerical Life, Silas Marner, and, in general, the other provincial novels, the dialect of North Warwickshrie. The above dialects do not differ greatly from the Leicestershire dialect and practically all of George Eliot's dialect words are given in Evans' Leicestershire words.

It is a very fine old place, of red brick, softened by a pale powdery lichen, which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity, so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limest.one ornaments surrounding the three gables, the windows, and the door-place. But the windows are patched with wooden panes, and the door, I think, is like the gateit is never opened: how it would groan and grate against the stone floor if it were! For it is a solid, heavy, handeome door, and must once have been in the habit of shutting with a sonorous bang behind a liveried lackey, who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair. . . But at present one might fancy the house in the early stage of a chancery suit and that the fruit from that grand double row of walnut-trees on the right hand of the enclosure would fall and rot among the grass."" The Hall Farm furnishes the setting for several of the important scenes in Adam Bede. Hetty Sorrel lives there with her aunt and Uncle Poyser, and Dinah Morris stays there when she is at Hayslope. It is in the farm dairy that Arthur Donnithorne sees Hetty, and in the garden, much later, Adam Bede and Hetty become engaged. In the Hall Farm kitchen Mrs. Poyser ""has her say out"" with her landlord, Squire Donnithorne, and in the kitchen, also, the Harvest Home supper is celebrated. While several originals of the Hall Farm have been suggested, the balance of opinion is in favour of Corley Hall, an old Jacobean house about four miles from Coventry and not far from George Eliot's childhood home at Nuneaton. The description of Corley Hall agrees in the main with that of the Hall Farm, except that the lionesses on the gatepost are griffins.

It was not a grove with measured grass or rolled gravel for you to tread upon, but with narrow, hollow-shaped, earthy paths, edged with faint dashes of delicate moss —paths which look as if they were made by the freewill of the trees and underwood, moving reverently aside to look at the tall queen of the whitefooted nymphs.""

""Sir Hugo was an easytempered man, tolerant both of differences and defects; but a point of view different from his own concerning the settlement of the family estates fretted him rather more than if it had concerned Church discipline, or the ballot, and faults were the less venial for belonging to a person whose existence was inconvenient to him.

""Hardly any man could be more good-natured than Sir Hugo ; indeed, in his kindliness, especially to women, he did actions which others would have called romantic ; but he never took a romantic view of them, and in general smiled at the introduction of motives on a grand scale, or of reasons that lay very far off."" In his youth he had been deeply in love with a beautiful prima donna, the Italian Jewess, Alcharisi, and at her request, after her husband's death, had taken charge of her young son, Daniel Deronda, to bring him up in England, as an Englishman and in ignorance of his race. When he marries, he has only daughters, and so gradually gives to his ward the affection that he would have given a son, ignorant of the fact that the secrecy maintained about his parentage has made Daniel believe that he is Sir Hugo's illegitimate son. He wishes Daniel to enter English public life, and when the latter, after his parentage and race are revealed to him, by his unknown mother, elects to call himself a Jew and work for his race, Sir Hugo is disappointed but is too genuinely attached to Daniel to oppose him.",,Daniel Deronda,,,,,"Mallinger, Sir Hugo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Text,Encyclopedia of Places and Characters,0,0

""Was she beautiful or not beautiful ? and what was the secret of form or expression which gave the dynamic quality to her glance ? Was the good or the evil genius dominant in those beams ? Probably the evil ; else why was the effect that of unrest rather than of undisturbed charm ? . . . The Nereid in sea-green robes and silver ornaments, with a pale sea-green feather fastened in silver falling backward over her green hat and light-brown hair, was Gwendolen Harleth."" ""Having always been the pet and pride of the household, waited on by mother, sisters, governess, and maids, as if she had been a princess in exile, she naturally found it difficult to think her own pleasure less important than others made it, and when it was positively thwarted, felt an astonished resentment, apt, in her cruder days, to vent itself in one of those passionate acts which look like a contradiction of habitual tendencies . . . Gwendolen's nature was not remorseless, but she liked to make her penances easy."" ""She meant to do what was pleasant to herself in a striking manner ; or, rather, whatever she could do so as to strike others with admiration and get in that reflected way a more ardent sense of living, seemed pleasant to her fancy. . ."" ""In her beauty, a certain unusualness about her, a decision of will which made itself felt in her graceful movements and clear unhesitating tones . . . However, she had the charm, and those who feared her were also fond of her ; the fear and the fondness being perhaps both heightened by what may be called the irridescence of her character —the play of various, nay, contrary tendencies."" Her beauty and aloofness attract the rich Mallinger Grandcourt, and she is about ready to accept him when she learns that he ought to marry Mrs. Glasher. Promising Mrs. Glasher not to marry Grandcourt, she goes away to escape his attentions, gambles at Leubronn, where she is influenced by seeing Daniel Deronda as she is losing, and is called home by the news that all her mother's property has been lost. As the only way of earning money herself which she can find is a hated position as governess, she marries Grandcourt in spite of her promise to Mrs. Glasher, attempting to quiet her conscience by the plea that she is doing it for her mother, to whom she is really attached. The false position in which she finds herself soon makes her unhappy, and she turns to Daniel Deronda, whose effect on her at Leubronn she has not forgotten, for spiritual aid, thereby arousing her husband's resentment and jealousy. Grandcourt's cruel and contemptuous attitude so arouses her hatred that she trifles with the idea that she could kill him, and when he is drowned before her eyes, she feels that her momentary delay in throwing him a rope makes her a murderess. In her remorse and despair she turns to Deronda as her only help, and from him gradually attains the beginning of a new spiritual attitude and unselfishness. When George Eliot was at Homburg in 1872 she was much impressed by a young lady whom she saw gambling there. This incident furnished the model for Gwendolen Harleth's gambling at Leubronn.

""She was covered, except as to her face and part of her arms, with black lace hanging loosely from the summit of her whitening hair to the long train stretching from her tall figure. Her arms, naked from the elbow, except for some rich bracelets, were folded before her, and the fine poise of her head made it look handsomer than it really was . . . her eyes were piercing and her face so mobile that the next moment she might look like a different person . . . there was a play of the brow and nostril which made a tacit language . . . She was a remarkablelooking being . . . Her worn beauty had a strangeness in it as if she were not quite a human mother, but a Melusina, who had ties with some world which is independent of ours. . ""This woman's nature was one in which all feeling—and all the more when it was tragic as well as real—immediately be came matter of conscious representation; experience immediately passed into drama, and she acted her own emotions. In a minor degree this is nothing un common, but in the Princess the acting had a rare perfection of physiognomy, voice, and gesture."" Brought up by a stern and orthodox father who believed intensely in his race and in the inferiority of women, she had come to hate both his authority and the thought of being a Jewess. At her father's wish she had married her cousin Charisi, but had bent his gentle nature to her will and had gone on the stage, where her wonderful voice and acting made her the leading prima donna of her time. With all her ambition centred on a great career she had no love for her baby (Daniel), and after her husband's early death she persuaded Sir Hugo Mallinger, one of her admirers, to take Daniel to England and bring him up in ignorance of his birth. Some time after, thinking that her voice was failing, she married the Prince Halm-Eberstein and retired from the stage. Believing that she had done the best thing for Daniel in having him brought up as a Christian Englishman, she had never intended to reveal herself to him, but when suffering from an incurable disease she becomes conscience stricken at the thought that she has thwarted her father's desire to have a grandson, and summons Deronda to meet her at Genoa, where she makes her self and his race known to him without responding in any way to the affection which he offers her. In his Life and Writings of Isaac Disraeli, by his Son, Benjamin Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield, gives an account of Isaac Disraeli's mother, which in some respects, particularly her intense resentment of her race and its social disadvantages and her lack of affection for her son, so resembles the Princess Halm-Eberstein, that it seems probable that George Eliot must have taken some touches in the portrait of Deronda's mother, and in the scene be tween mother and son, from this original.

He was slightly taller than herself, and their eyes seemed to be on a level; there was not the faintest smile on his face as he looked at her, not a trace of self-consciousness or anxiety in his bearing ; when he raised his hat he showed an extensive baldness surrounded with a mere fringe of reddishblond hair, but he also showed a perfect hand; the line of feature from brow to chin undisguised by beard was decidedly handsome, with only moderate departures from the perpendicular, and the slight whisker, too, was per pendicular. It was not possible for a human aspect to be freer from grimace or solicitous wrigglings; also it was perhaps not possible for a breathing man wide awake to look less animated. . . .

Although possessed of large estates, he has spent so freely on his pleasures that he feels some need of ready money. Some years before, he had run away with the beautiful and dashing Mrs. Glasher and his passion for her had been the strongest of which he was capable, although it had not induced him to marry her when her husband's death finally left her free. He comes to Diplow with some idea of courting the rich Miss Arrowpoint, but is attracted by Gwendolen Harleth's beauty and independence, and, led on by the fact that she holds him off and even goes away to escape his attentions, makes up his mind to marry her. For a while he feels as much liking for her as his worn-out nature permits, but her attitude toward Deronda, innocent though it is, arouses his jealousy and he determines to break her spirit and bend her to his idea of what his wife should be, heedless of the hatred which this arouses in her.

22188,https://georgeeliotarchive.org/items/show/22188,"Deronda, Daniel",Character Name,"The Jewish hero of the story; Sir Hugo Mallinger's ward, a handsome and gifted young man who passes as Sir Hugo's nephew but is mistakenly believed by many to be his son. ""Rowing in his dark-blue shirt and skull-cap, his curls closely clipped, his mouth beset with abundant soft waves of beard, he bore only disguised traces of the seraphic boy 'trailing clouds of glory'... Look at his hands... they are long, flexible, firmly grasping hands, such as Titian has painted in a picture where he wanted to show the combination of refinement with force. And there is something of a likeness, too, between the faces belonging to the hands--in both the uniform pale-brown skin, the perpendicular brow, the calmly penetrating eyes."" ""His eyes had a peculiarity which has drawn many men into trouble; they were of a dark yet mild intensity, which seemed to express a special interest in every one on whom he fixed them, and might easily help to bring on him those claims which ardently sympathetic people are often creating in the minds of those who need help."" ""To say that Deronda was romantic would be to misrepresent him; but under his calm and somewhat self-repressed exterior there was a fervour which made him easily find poetry and romance among the events of every-day life."" As a child he had been brought to England by Sir Hugo and educated as one of his own family. He is sensitive about his ignorance of his parentage, though much attached to Sir Hugo whom he believes to be his father, and his equivocal position makes him restless and unsettled. At the opening of the story he sees Gwendolen Harleth gambling at Leubronn, and his disapproval disturbs her then and influences her later, when, after her return to England, she marries Grandcourt, Sir Hugo's nephew, and she and Deronda are thus thrown together in the same social circle. While rowing on the Thames Deronda saves Mirah Cohen, a beautiful Jewess who is attempting suicide, finding a refuge for her with his friends the Meyricks and continuing to watch over her. In his efforts to trace Mirah's lost brother, Ezra, he forms a strong friendship with Mordecai Cohen, becomes interested in Jewish questions through him, and eventually discovers that Mordecai is Mirah's brother Ezra and falls in love with Mirah. Meanwhile he feels a different kind of interest in Gwendolen who, in the unhappiness of her marriage, appeals to him for advice and guidance. When his acquaintance with Mordecai and Mirah has thoroughly aroused his interest in the Jews, he is summoned to Genoa to meet his hitherto unknown mother, the Princess Halm-Eberstein, learns from her that he is a Jew, and rejoices in the information. While he is still at Genoa, Grandcourt is drowned in the Mediterranean, and Deronda supports Gwendolen in her remorse and despair, and later she turns to him as her one source of help. On his return to England he devotes himself to work for the Jews, marries Mirah, and with her goes to Palestine to try to realize Mordecai's dream of a revival of Jewish nationalism. According to Sir Leslie Stephen, Edmund Gurney (1847-1888) may have been, in sorne respects at least, the original of Daniel Deronda. Deronda's personal appearance was taken from the Christ in Titian's picture, the ""Tribute Money"", which haunted George Eliot for years after she had seen it in the Dresden gallery.

Then see the perfect cameo her profile maeks, cut in a duskish shell where by some happy fortune there pierced a gem-like darkness for the eye and eyebrow; the delicate nostrils defined enough to be ready for sensitive movements, the finished ear, the firm curves of the chin and neck entering into the expression of a refinement which was not feebleness."" When she was a young child her father, an actor, had taken her away from her mother and brother, and for many years they led a Bohemian life distasteful to Mirah, who was strongly attached to the Jewish faith. In order to escape the dishonourable attentions of a man seconded by her father, she runs away from her father and comes to London to seek her mother and brother. Unsuccessful in her search, worn out and penniliess, she attempts to drown herself in the Thames, but is rescued by Daniel Deronda, and taken to Mrs. Meyrick. Here her voice, which has been carefully trained, supports her, and when her brother Ezra, or Mordecai, is found she cares for him tenderly until his death.

""A man in threadbare clothing, whose age was difficult to guess--from the dead yellowish flatness of the flesh, something like an old ivory carving... precisely such a physiognomy as that might possibly have been seen in a prophet of the Exile, or in some New Hebrew poet of the medieval time. It was a finely typical Jewish face, wrought into intensity of expression apparently by a strenuous eager experience in which all the satisfaction had been indirect and far off, and perhaps by some bodily suffering also, which involved that absence of ease in the present. The feature were clear-cut, not large; the brow not high, but broad, and fully defined by the crisp black hair. It might never have been a particularly handsome face, but it must always have been forcible."" ""A man steeped in poverty and obscurity, weakened by disease, consciously within the shadow of advancing death, but living an intense life in an invisible past and future, careless of his personal lot, except for its possibly making some obstruction to a conceived good which he would never share except as a brief inward vision--a day afar off, whose sun would never warm him, but into which he threw his sou's desire, with a passion often wanting to the personal motives of healthy youth."" His whole life is wrapped up in his belief in the regeneration of a great Jewish nationality in Palestine if only the right leader of the race can be found. As a young man he had started east to work in Palestine, when he was recalled because his mother needed his help after her husband had deserted her. The need of caring for his mother and the consumption which he develops from exposure make him give up the idea of his own leadership, and when Daniel Deronda meets him he is living in semi-poverty as a watch mender in the Cohen pawnshop and an off-hour attendant in Mr. Ram's book shop, constantly hoping to find the leader on whom his mantle can descend. He sees in Deronda this destined leader, introduces Deronda to the Philosphers' Club at the ""Hand and Banner"", and rouses his keen interest both in the Jewish race and in the thought that he may be a Jew himself. Throught Deronda's instrumentality, his relationship to Mirah is discovered, and after Deronda and Mirah are married he dies happy in the belief that they will realize his dream. The original of Mordecai was a Jewish journeyman watchmaker, name Cohn, or Kohn, who was president of a philosophical club in Red Lion Square, which G. H. Lewes frequented in his youth, and which he describes in the Fortnightly Review, vol. 4, p. 386. To the personal characteristics of this Cohn, as Lewes described him, George Eliot added the belief in a renewed Jewish nationality, which she is said to have taken from a Moldavian Jew possessed of the same idea whom she met in Munich.

He was addicted at once to rebellion and to conformity, and only an intimate personal knowledge could enable any one to predict where his conformity would begin . . . In fact, Harold Transome was a clever, frank, good-natured egoist; not stringently consistent, but without any disposition to falsity; proud, but with a pride that was moulded in an individual rather than an hereditary form; unspeculative, unsentimental, unsympathetic; fond of sensual pleasures, but disinclined to all vice, and ttached as a healthy, clear sighted person, to all conventional morality, construed with a certain freedom."" In his youth he had gone to the East, where he married a Greek woman, originally a slave, and made a fortune. A widower of thirty-four, he returns to England when his brother's death makes him the heir to the Transome estates. Breaking with the family traditions of Toryism, he stands for Parliament as a Radical, and is defeated after an exciting campaign and election. In looking into the estate business management, he finds that Mr. Jermyn, the family lawyer, has taken advantage of his position to his own profit, and starts legal proceedings against him. When he learns that Esther Lyon is the rightful owner of the estate he becomes genuinely interested in her, wants to marry her, but fails to win her love.

""Her figure was slim and finely formed, though she was between fifty and sixty. She was a tall, proud-looking woman, with abundant grey hair, dark eyes and eyebrows, and a somewhat eaglelike, yet not unfeminine, face. Her tight-fitting black dress was much worn; the fine lace of her cuffs and collar, and of the small veil which fell backwards over her high comb, was visibly mended; but rare jewels flashed on her hands, which lay on her folded black-clad arms, like finely cut onyx cameos ... "" ""Crosses, mortifications, money cares, conscious blameworthiness, had changed the aspect of the world for her; there was anxiety in the morning sunlight ; there was unkind triumph or disapproving pity in the glances of greeting neighbours . . . Mrs. Transome, whose imperious will had availed little to ward off the great evils of her life, found the opiate for her discontent in the exertion of her will about smaller things. She was not cruel, and could not enjoy thoroughly what I she called the old woman's pleasure of tormenting; but she liked every little sign of power her lot had left her. She liked that a tenant should stand bareheaded below her as she eat on horseback. She liked to insist that work done without her orders should be undone from beginning to end ... a woman's keen sensibility and dread ... lay screened behind all her petty habits and narrow notions."" As a proud young beauty of good family but little money, she had made a loveless marriage with the feeble Mr. Transome. Feeling no fondnees for either her husband or her half-idiot eldest son, she had responded to the attentions of the handsome young lawyer, Jermyn, and later had centred all her love and pride in her second son, Harold, a healthy handsome boy. Her dominating nature makes her enjoy managing the estate in place of her feeble husband, but lawsuits and the charges which the unscrupulous Jermyn has fastened on the estate have greatly reduced the income. On the death of her disreputable eldest son she eagerly anticipates Harold's return from the East, where he has gone to make his fortune, and expects to find in his devotion a solace for all her dissatisfactions. She is bitterly disappointed when, instead of this devotion, he gives her merely a good-humoured, condescending affection; feels the loss of authority when he does not defer to her about the management of the estate; and watches with helpless dread the growing antagonism between him and Jermyn. Finally, when Jermyn, in a public quarrel, tells Harold that he is his father, her unhappy secret is revealed to her son.

""He was walking about now, with his hands clasped behind him, an attitude in which his body seemed to bear about the same proportion to his head as the lower part of a stone Hermes bears to the carven image that crowns it. His face looked old and worn, yet the curtain of hair that fell from his bald crown and hung about his neck retained much of its original auburn tint, and his large, brown, short-sighted eyes were still clear and bright. At the first glance, every one thought him a very odd-looking rusty old man; the free-school boys often hooted after him and called him ""Revelations""; and to many respectable church people old Lyon's little legs and large head seemed to make Dissent additionally preposterous. But he was too shortsighted to notice those who tittered at him-too absent from the world of small facts and petty impulses in which titterers live."" ""Once in his life he had been blinded, deafened, hurried along by rebellious impulse ; he had gone astray after his own desires, and had let the fire die out on the altar ; and as the true penitent, hating his self-besotted error, asks from all coming life duty instead of joy, and service instead of ease, so Rufus was perpetually on the watch lest he should ever again postpone to some private affection a great public opportunity which to him was equivalent to a command."" Twenty-two years before the opening of the story Rufus Lyon was an eloquent and successful minister of a large Independent Chapel, when Annette Ledru came suddenly into his life. The death of her husband, Maurice Christian Bycliffe, had left her penniless in a strange land, and Mr. Lyon took her and her baby into his home, in spite of the criticism of his congregation, fell deeply in love with her, and gave up his high calling to watch over her and her child. After a time the grateful Annette married him and when she died, three years later, he returned to the ministry, and brought up the baby, Esther, as his own daughter. At the opening of the story he is leading, in humble surroundings, a life of wrapt absorption in his work and loving devotion to Esther, who still believes herself his daughter. When events make him believe that she should no longer be kept in ignorance of her parentage he tells her the full story and leaves her free to decide whether or not she will claim the inheritance and rank to which she is apparently entitled. The original of Rufus Lyon was the Reverend Francis Franklin, a Baptist minister, who for fifty-four years, from 1799 until his death in 1852, was pastor of the Cow Lane Chapel, in Coventry. Mr. Franklin was the father of the Misses Franklin, whose school in Coventry George Eliot attended, and the character of Rufus Lyon is said by those who remembered him, to be a faithful portrait.

He would not observe her, but he had a sense of an elastic walk, the tread of small feet, a long neck, and a high crown of shining brown plaits with curls that floated backward — things, in short, that suggested a fine lady . . . Esther had that excellent thing in woman, a soft voice with a clear fluent utterance. Her sauciness was always charming, because it was without emphasis, and was accompanied with graceful little turns of the head."" ""She had one of those exceptional organizations which are quick and sensitive without being in the least morbid ; she was alive to the finest shades of manner, to the nicest distinctions of tone and accent . . . Her own pretty instep, clad in a silk stocking, her little heel, just rising from a kid slipper, her irreproachable nails and delicate wrist, were the objects of delighted consciousness to her; and she felt that it was her superiority which made her unable to use without disgust any but the finest cambric handkerchiefs and freshest gloves. Her money all went in the gratification of these nice tastes, and she saved nothing from her earnings . . . she hated all meanness, would empty her purse impulsively on some sudden appeal to her pity, and if she found out that her father had a want she would supply it with some pretty device of a surprise."" She had been brought up as the daughter of Rufus Lyon, the Independent minister, and while fond of her father has little sympathy with his simple tastes and life. Through her father she meets Felix Holt. and while at first repelled by his surface roughness, soon becomes interested in him and in the lectures that he gives her. Fearing that she may hear the story from someone else, Rufus Lyon tells her that he is not her real father, and that she is the daughter of Maurice Christian Bycliffe. She is much touched by his story of his devotion and marriage to her mother, and gains a different appreciation of his life and character. Later, after she learns that she is the rightful owner of the Transome estates, she goes to Transome Court to visit Mrs. Transome, and there is courted by Harold Transome. What she sees at Transome Court shows her that wealth does not necessarily bring happiness, and as Felix Holt's trial for manslaughter has opened her eyes to the strength of her real feeling for him, she gives up her claim to the estate to marry Felix. While George Eliot's portrait of Esther Lyon is not autobiographic to anything like the same extent as that of the character of Maggie Tulliver (in Mill on the Floss), there are some things in it--the fastidiousness, niceness about dress, etc.-for which the author's own tastes and habits supplied the original.

He was massively built. The striking points in his face were large clear grey eyes and full lips."" ""His strong health, his renunciation of selfish claims, his habitual preoccupation with large thoughts and with purposes in dependent of everyday casualties, secured him a fine and even temper, free from moodiness or irritability. He was full of longsuffering towards his unwise mother ... he had chosen to fill his days in a way that required the utmost exertion of patience, that required those little rill-like out-flowings of goodness which in minds of great energy must be fed from deep sources of thought and passionate devotedness. In this way his energies served to make him gentle; and now, in this twenty-sixth year of his life, they had ceased to make him angry, except in the presence of something that roused his deep indignation."" He has been well educated and could live in comfortalbe and ""respectable"" circumstances, but prefers to give up outside refinements to live in poverty among the people whom he wishes to serve. His father had invented some quack medicines upon the sale of which his widowed mother lived comfortably, but Felix, who knows that the medicines are worthless, forces her to give up selling them, and provides for her himself. Mrs. Holt, who objects strongly to giving up the medicines, asks the Reverend Mr. Lyon to reason with Felix, and through the minister Felix meets Esther, with whom he soon falls in love, although at first he sees only surface qualities and faults about which he lectures her. He is interested in the parliamentary campaign in which Harold Transome is the Radical candidate, and fears that some of the practices which he has seen will result in trouble. When a serious election riot does occur, Felix tries to turn the mob and unintentionally kills a constable. He is tried for manslaughter and sentenced to four years' imprisonment in spite of the testimony of his friends, including Esther Lyon, who is now known to be the rightful possessor of the Transome estates. Eventually he is pardoned and learns that Esther has given up wealth and position because she returns his love. The two are married and move away from Treby. Some features of Felix Holt were drawn from Gerald Massey.the socialist-poet. (See Collins, Studies, p. 148; Diet, nat. biog.) Another original has been suggested in John Farn, of the vicinity of Nuneaton, a ribbon weaver and labour agitator with a gift for oratory. See article in Great Thoughts from Master Minds, March, 1901, pp. 369-70.

21956,https://georgeeliotarchive.org/items/show/21956,Bylciffe versus Transome,Event,"Lawsuit instituted by Maurice Christian Bycliffe, Esther Lyon's father, to obtain possession of the Transome estate. John Justus Transome in 1729 had made a settlement of his estates entailing them on his son Thomas and his heirs-male, with remainder to the Bycliffes in fee. Thomas, a prodigal, had sold his own and his descendants' rights to a lawyer-cousin named Durfey, whose descendants, the Durfey-Transomes (the Transomes of the story), are the rightful holders of the estate as long as there exists a male descendant of Thomas Transome. In the absence of such male descendant the right to the estate would pass to the Bycliffes. The complicated legal plot of the story rests upon this Durfey-Transome-Bycliffe situation and the fact that Esther Lyon's claim (as the last Bycliffe) becomes valid on the death of old Tommy Trounsem, the last descendant of Thomas Transome. In order to be sure that she was right in her handling of a plot based upon a question of law, George Eliot consulted Frederic Harrison, who suggested the legal scheme of the story and wrote the lawyer's ""opinion on the case"", which was incorporated in the novel. Frederic Harrison said later: ""I remember telling her, when she inserted these lines in the book, that I had written at least a sentence which was embodied in English literature.""

""Treby Magna, on which the Reform Bill had thrust the new honour of being a polling-place, had been, at the beginning of the century, quite a typical old market-town, lying in pleasant sleepiness among green pastures, with a rush-fringed river meandering through them. Its principal street had various handsome and tall-windowed brick houses with walled gardens behind them; and at the end, where it widened into the market-place, there was the cheerful rough-stuccoed front of that excellent inn, the Marquis of Granby . . . And the church was one of those fine old English structures worth travelling to see, standing in a broad churchyard with a line of solemn yew-treesbeside it, and lifting a majestic tower and spire far above the redand-purple roofs of the town. . . Treby Magna gradually passed from being simply a respectable market-town—the heart of agreat rural district, where the trade was only such as had close relations with the local landed interest—and took on the more complex life brought by mines and manufactures."" It has been suggested that in the original of Treby Magna was the ancient town of Coventry, in Warwickshire, where George Eliot lived for some time, but beyond the fact that there was a Coventry original for Rufus Lyon's chapel, there seems to be nothing to support this suggestion.

23679,https://georgeeliotarchive.org/items/show/23679,"Tryan, Reverend Edgar",Character Name,"The evangelical curate at Paddiford Common, Milby, by whose in fluence Janet Dempster is rescued. ""The strange light from the golden sky falling on his light brown hair, which is brushed high up round his head, makes it look almost like an aureole. His grey eyes, too, shine with unwonted brilliancy this evening. They were not remarkable eyes, but they accorded completely in their changing light with the changing expression of his person, which indicated the paradoxial character often observable in a large-limbed sanguine blond; at once mild and irritable, gentle and overbearing, indolent and resolute, self-con scious and dreamy."" ""But Mr. Tryan was not cast in the mould of the gratuitous martyr. With a power of persistence which had been often blamed as obstinacy, he had an acute sensibility to the very hatred or ridicule he did not flinch from provoking. Every form of disapproval jarred him painfully; and, though he fronted his opponents manfnlly, and often with considerable warmth of temper, he had no pugnacious pleasure in the contest. It was one of the weaknesses of his nature to be too keenly alive to every harsh wind of opinion."" In his youth he had been wild, and the realization of his sins had caused him to enter the churoh and to devote his life to others. When he comes to Milby he has to struggle against the indifference of those whom he would help and the malevolent opposition of  Lawyer Dempster. In the end his sympathy, faith, and high purpose give him the victory, for which, however, he pays with his life. He dies happy in the knowledge that, through his influence, Janet Dempster has been rescued from despair. There was undoubtedly an original for the story of the persecution of Mr. Tryan. George Eliot, in 1857, said: ""The story, as far as regards the persecution, is a real bit in the religious history of England that happened about eight and twenty years ago."" The Reverend W. P. Jones wrote to William Blackwood that Mr. Tryan was drawn from his deceased brother but George Eliot disclaimed this, saying: ""Mr. Tryan is not a portrait of any clergyman, living or dead.""

""Rosamond was not one of those helpless girls who betray themselves unawares, and whose behavior is awkwardly driven by their impulses, instead of being steered by wary grace and propriety . . . Rosamond never showed any unbecoming knowledge, and was always that combination of correct sentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private album for extracted verse, and perfect blonde loveliness, which made the irresistible woman for the doomed man of that date . . . She was not in the habit of devising falsehoods, and if her statements were no direct clew to fact, why, they were not intended in that light— they were among her elegant accomplishments, intended to please. Nature had inspired many arts in finishing Mrs. Lemon's favourite pupil, who by general consent (Fred's excepted) was a rare compound of beauty, cleverness, and amiability."" She holds herself above the young men of Middlemarch, but is attracted by Dr. Lydgate's superior breeding and connexions, falls as much in love with him as her self-centred nature will permit, and marries him without having the slightest understanding of his nobility of character and mind, and with no sympathy with his high aims in his profession. Worldly success measured in terms of income and social prestige is the only ambition which she can understand; she demands to be kept in luxury, refuses to yield to any of Lydgate's wishes, and to all of his attempts to explain to her his needs and his professional aims she opposes a gentle, inflexible obstinacy before which he is helpless. In the end he has to sacrifice his high ideals and scientific ambition and move to London in order to make the money necessary to give her the social position she craves.

When his uncle dies, leaving his money to a natural son, Fred receives nothing and finds it necessary to decide what he is to make of himself, as his father cannot support him in idleness. Since childhood he has loved Mary Garth, and it is mainly through her influence that he disappoints his family and gives up the Church, for which he has been educated. Through Fred's thoughtlessness Mr. Garth loses money which he can ill afford to spare, but in spite of that, for Mary's sake, takes Fred into his office as his assistant, and Fred applies himself to his new work in the hope of winning Mary. His generous rival, Mr. Farebrother, helps him at a critical period.

""One of Lydgate's gifts was a voice habitually deep and sonorous, yet capable of becoming very low and gentle at the right moment. About his ordinary bearing there was a certain fling, a fearless expectation of success, aconfidence in his own powers and integrity, much fortified by contempt for petty obstacles or seductions of which he had had no experience. But this proud openness was made lovable by an expression of unaffected good will."" ""His scientific interest soon took the form of a professional enthusiasm; he had a youthful belief in his bread-winning work . . . and he carried to his studies . . . the conviction that the medical profession as it might be was the finest in the world . . . But he did not simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common. He was ambitious of a wider effect : he was fired with the possibility that he might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link in the chain of discovery . . . Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific, rational basis of his profession."" He settles in Middlemarch, intending not only to be a good doctor, but also to carry on scientific investigation, for which he is well fitted. Captivated by Rosamond Vincy's beauty and grace, he marries her and soon discovers that she is absolutely selfish and unresponsive to his tender love, with no sympathy for his high aims. His opposition to accepted medical usages makes him unpopular with the other physicians of Middlemarch, and his connexion with Mr. Bulstrode leads him into trouble. His wife has only blame for him, and all his endeavours to economize are stubbornly opposed by her. The struggle between him and Rosamond, who demands position and luxury at any price, ends in the subjection of his higher self, and his noblest aims are sacrificed to worldly success. To meet the demands of her ambition he is forced to move to London, and become a fashionable physician, and dies there at a comparatively early age. The high-minded, medical side of Lydgate is said to have been drawn from the Rt. Hon. Sir T. Clifford Allbutt, Regius Professor of Physic, Cambridge, who, when Middlemarch was written, was head of the Leeds Fever Hospital which George Eliot visited. The portraiture is but partial and the circumstances different. (Manuscript notes.) George Eliot's friend and biographer, Mr. Oscar Browning, has also been suggested as the prototype, in part.

""Will Ladislaw's smile was delightful, unless you were angry with him beforehand; it was a gush of inward light illuminating the transparent skin as well as the eyes, and playing about every curve and line as if some Ariel were touching them with a new charm, and banishing forever the traces of moodiness . . . The first impression on seeing Will was one of sunny brightness, which added to the uncertainty of his changing expression. Surely, his very features changed their form; his jaw looked sometimes large and sometimes small; and the little ripple in his nose was a preparation for metamorphosis. When he turned his head quickly his hair seemed to shake out light, and some persons thought they saw decided genius in this coruscation."" His grandmother, Mr. Casaubon's aunt, had been disinherited because she made a mesalliance, by marrying a poor Pole, and Mr. Casaubon, who feels an inherited responsibility for this, had educated Will. With artistic tastes, some ability as a writer, and a disregard for worldly considerations he has some difficulty in choosing a profession. When he meets Dorothea as Mr. Casaubon's wife he first becomes interested in her, and then grows to love her with constancy and devotion, and for the sake of being near her settles in Middlemarch as editor of Mr. Brooke's paper. His sense of honour causes him to refuse Mr. Bulstrode's offer of money, dishonestly gained, which should have been his mother's. When Dorothea, after a short widowhood, gives up position and fortune to marry him, he enters public life, without promise of marked success. It has been suggested that some traits in the character of Will Ladislaw were drawn, perhaps unconsciously, from George Henry Lewes, who, also, was a man of versatile talent and lively manner. Some critics, however, do not recognize Lewes as the original. Those who consider Lewes as the prototype find one of their arguments in the author's very evident fondness for the character of Ladislaw.

He was one of those rare men who are rigid to themselves and indulgent to others. He had a certain shame about his neighbour's errors, and never spoke of them willingly."" ""His virtual divinities were good, practical schemes, accurate work, and the faithful completion of undertakings: his prince of darkness was a slack workman. ... In fact, he had a reverential soul with a strong, practical intelligence. But he could not manage finance: he knew values well, but he had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape of profit and loss: and having ascertained this to his cost, he determined to give up all forms of his beloved 'business' which required that talent. He . . . was one of those precious men within his own district whom everybody would choose to work for them, because he did his work well, charged very little, and often declined to charge at all. It is no wonder, then, that the Garths were poor, and 'lived in a small way However, they did not mind it."" ""With regard to a large number of matters about which other men are decided or obstinate, he was the most easily manageable man in the world.

But where Caleb's feeling and judgment strongly pronounced, he was a ruler; and in spite of his mildness and timidity in reproving, every one about him knew that on the exceptional occasion, when he chose, he was absolute.""  He had failed in the building business but had eventually paid his creditors in full.

He accepts a good position from Mr. Bulstrode, but when he learns of Mr. Bulstrode's dishonest career, his uncompromising honesty forces him to give this up. It is generally agreed that many of Caleb Garth's marked characteristics —his occupation as builder and land agent, his uncompromising uprightness, delight in his work, love of the soil, perhaps even his domestic submissiveness — were drawn from Robert Evans, George Eliot's father, although the character is not an exact portrait of the original.

Then, his preaching was ingenious and pithy, like the preaching of the English Church in its robust age, and his sermons were delivered without book.

""Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily frame, and his soul was sensitive without being enthusiastic; it was too languid to thrill out of self-consciousness
into passionate delight; it went on fluttering in the swampy ground where it was hatched, thinking of its wings and never flying. His experience was of that pitiable kind which shrinks from pity, and fears most of all that it should be
known; it was that proud, narrow sensitiveness which has not mass enough to spare for transformation into sympathy, and quivers thread-like in small currents of self-preoccupation or at best of an egoistic scrupulosity. And Mr. Casaubon had many scruples; he was capable of severe self-restraint; resolute he was in being a man of honour according to the code; he would be unimpeachable by any recognized opinion . . . the difficulty of making his Key to all Mythologies unimpeachable weighed like lead upon his mind . . . even his religious faith wavered with his wavering trust in his own authorship, and the consolations of the Christian hope in immortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the still unwritten Key to all Mythologies."" He marries Dorothea Brooke, who has idealized him, and soon proves himself selfishly blind to her claims, and incapable of responding to her devotion. His ambition is centred in his projected masterpiece, ""Key to all Mythologies,"" but he lacks the ability necessary to carry it to completion. Because Dorothea manifests a friendly interest in his young kinsman, Will Ladislaw, he becomes unreasonably jealous, and when he dies some two years after his marriage, he leaves a codicil to his will depriving Dorothea of his property in case she marries Ladislaw. It has been claimed by some that the Reverend Mark pattison, Rector of Lincoln, was the original of Mr. Casaubon, while others have indignantly denied this. Mark Pattison was a visitor at George Eliot's home, and it is possible that she may, unconsciously, have copied some of his superficial characteristics. This, together with the name--Mark Pattison's best known work was his life of Isaac Casaubon--may have given rise to the report that he was the original.

Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Vergin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain garments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible--or from one of our elder poets--in a paragraph of today's newspaper. She was usually spoken of as being remakably clever, but with the addition that sister Celia had more common-sense."" ""She came into the drawing room in her silver-grey dress--the simple lines of her dark brown hair parted over her brown and coiled massively behind, in keeping with the entire absence from her manner and expression of all searc after mere effect. Sometimes when Dorothea was in the company there seemed to be as complete an air of repose about her as if she had been a picture of Santa Barbara.""

Dorothea at nineteen marries the middle-aged and pedantic Mr. Casaubon because she is in love with the idea of being a helpmate to him in his great work. She soon realizes that she has idealized her husband, who is a cold, jealous, and selfish man, engaged in a work of no real value. Although the shock of the disilluison is great and her intense nature at times rebels, she loyally devotes herself to Mr. Casaubon while he lives. She is on the point of sacrificing her future happiness by making him a promise, which, though she does not know its nature, would have separated her from Will Ladislaw, his young cousin, when Mr. Casaubon dies. Eventually she gives up her social position and Mr. Casaubon's money in order to marry Will Ladislaw.

""But on safe opportunities she had an indirect mode of making her negative wisdom tell upon Dorothea, and calling her down from her rhapsodic mood by reminding her that people were staring, not listening. Celia was not impulsive; what she had to say could wait, and came from her always with the same quite staccato evenness."" Her sense of propriety is often shocked by Dorothea's unconventional views and deeds, and she occasionally has courage to utter her criticisms. She dislikes Mr. Casaubon, to whose blinking and moles she strongly objects.

""If this young man had been less elegant in his person, he would have been remarked for the elegance of his dress. But the perfections of his slim, well-proportioned figure were so striking that no one but a tailor could notice the perfections of his velvet coat; and his small white hands, with their blue veins and taper fingers, quite eclipsed the beauty of his lace ruffles. The face, however—it was difficult to say why—was certainly not pleasing. Nothing could be more delicate than the blond complexion—its bloom set off by the powdered hair—than the veined overhanging eyelids, which gave an indolent expression to the hazel eyes ; nothing more finely cut than the transparent nostril and the short upper-lip. Perhaps the chin nd lower jaw were too small for an irreproachable profile, but the defect was on the side of that delicacy and finesse which was the distinctive characteristic of the whole person, and which was carried out in the clear brown arch of the eyebrows, and the marble smoothness of the sloping forehead."" He deliberately wins the love of Caterina, his uncle's penniless protegee, without intending to marry her. In response to his uncle's wishes he becomes engaged to the beauty, Miss Assher, and gives no thought to the suffering he causes Caterina. When her jealousy annoys him, his weak heart causes his death. Charles Parker, nephew and heir of Sir Roger Newdigate (""Sir Christopher Cheverel"") was, in the matter of his personal appearance, his relation to a rich and childless uncle and his sudden death, the original of Captain Wybrow. Captain Wybrow's love affair with Caterina is purely fictitious, however, as Sally Shilton (""Caterina"") was only a child at the time of Charles Parker's marriage to Miss Anstruther (""Miss Assher"").

""You are at once arrested by her large dark eyes, which, in their inexpressive unconscious beauty, resemble the eyes of a fawn; and it is only by an effort of attention that you notice the absence of bloom on her young cheek, and the southern yellowish tint of her small neck and face, rising above the little black lace kerchief which prevents the too immediate comparison of her skin with her white muslin gown. Her large eyes seem all the more striking because the dark hair is gathered away from her face, under a little cap set at the top of her head, with a cherry colored bow on one side. ""With one exception, her only talent lay in loving ; and there, it is probable, the most astronomical of women could not have surpassed her. Orphan and protegee though she was, this supreme talent of hers found plenty of exercise at Cheverel Manor . . . the one other exceptional talent, you already guess, was music."" ""Said Mr. Bates, 'for she hasn't the cut of a gell as must work for her bread; she's as nesh an' dilicate as a paichblossom—welly laike a linnet, wi' on'y joost body anoof to hold her voice.' "" She falls in love with the handsome unscrupulous Captain Wybrow, and when he heartlessly forsakes her for Miss Assher, she is maddened by jealousy. She goes to meet him in the Rookery, thinking that she will kill him. When she reaches the Rookery she finds him dead. Many months later, when she has partially recovered from the shock, her affectionate heart leads her to marry Mr. Gilfil, her faithful lover, but she lives only a few months after their marriage. The prototype of Caterina was Sally Shilton, a young girl with a beautiful voice who has brought up and educated by Lady Newdigate (""Lady Cheverel""). Sally Shilton married Bernard Gilpin Ebdell ("" Maynard Gilfil "") but did not die at an early age, as did Caterina.

"" The Vicar did not shine in the more spiritual functions of his office; and indeed, the utmost I can say for him in this respect is, that he performed those functions with undeviating attention to brevity and despatch. He had a large heap of short sermons, rather yellow and worn at the edges, from which he took two every Sunday, securing perfect impartiality in the selection by taking them as they came without reference to topics; and having preached one of these sermons at Shepperton in the morning, he mounted his horse and rode hastily with the other in his pocket to Knebley, where he officiated in a wonderful little church .... Here, in an absence of mind to which he was prone, Mr. Gillil would sometimes forget to take off his spurs before putting on his surplice, and only become aware of the omission by feeling something mysteriously tugging at the skirts of that garment as he stepped into the reading-desk."" ""The dear old Vicar, though he had something of the knotted whimsical character of the poor lopped oak, had yet been sketched out by nature as a noble tree. The heart of him was sound, the grain was of the finest, and in the grey-haired man who filled his pocket with sugar-plums for the little children, whose most biting words were directed against the evil-doing of the rich man, and who, with all his social pipes and slipshod talk, never sank below the highest level of his parishioners' respect, there was the main trunk of the same brave, faithful, tender nature that had poured out the finest, freshest forces of its life-current in a first and only love—the love of Tina."" All through his youth he loves the little Italian, Caterina, and tries to watch over her during her unhappy love affair with the worthless Captain Wybrow. After she partially recovers from the shock of Captain Wybrow's death he marries her, and has a few months of great happiness as her husband. When she dies, that side of his life is closed forever, and he lives a solitary life among his parishioners, all of whom admire and respect him greatly. The Reverend Bernard Gilpin Ebdell, who married Sally Shilton (""Caterina""), was the original of Maynard Gilfil. It has been suggested that some touches in his character are taken from the Reverend Henry Hake, vicar of Chilvers Coton from 1844- 1859. (See Andrews, Bygone Warwickshire, p. 271 ; Olcott, George Eliot, pp. 15, 33 ; also article by George Morley in Gentleman's Magazine, n.s., vol. 45, p. 583.)

""And he had been docile, pliable, quick of apprehension, ready to acquire; a very bright lovely boy, a youth of even splendid grace, who seemed quite without vices, as if that beautiful form represented a vitality so exquisitely poised and balanced that it could know no uneasy desires, no unrest--a radiant presence for a lonely man to have won for himself. If he were silent when his father expected some response, still he did not look moody; if he declined some labour--why he flung himself down with such a charming, half-smiling, halfpleading air, that the pleasure of looking at him made amends . . . the curves of Tito's mouth had ineffable good humour in them. And then, the quick talent to which everything came readily, from philosophical systems to the rhymes of a street ballad caught up at a hearing!"" ""[He] made almost every one fond of him, for he was young, and clever, and beautiful, and his manners to all were gentle and kind. I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of anything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as his own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds-such as make men infamous. He denied his father, and left him to misery; he betrayed every trust that was reposed in him, that he might keep himself safe and get rich and prosperous."" He owes everything to his foster-father, Baldassarre CaJvo, who had brought him up as his own son. On a trip to Delos their boat was attacked by pirat.es and Baldassarre was captured, while Tito, who was carrying all their fortune in gems, escaped by swimming. In Florence, to which he makes his way after this misfortune, his brightness and charm
at once win him friends-Tessa, the contadina, shares her breakfast with him, and Nello, the barber, takes him under his protection and introduces him to the blind scholar, Bardo de' Bardi, through whose aid he succeeds in selling his gems and obtaining a post as professor of Greek. He acts as secretary to Bardo, winning both the confidence of the old scholar and the love of Bardo's beautiful daughter, Romola. Tito has allowed himself to keep up an acquaintance with Tessa, and eventually as a jest goes through a mock marriage with her. After selling his gems for a large sum he had made no attempt to use the money to find his father, persuading himself, instead, that the old man must be dead, and he even rejects a direct appeal for aid which the monk, Fra Luca, brings him from his father. His marriage to Romola is at first happy, but many things, especially his bad faith in selling her father's library, soon make her see that he is faithless and conscienceless, and they drift apart. When Baldassarre Calvo, as an escaped prisoner, comes upon Tito in Florence, Tito denies him and later even carries his treachery so far as to have Baldassarre imprisoned for two years. His tact and versatility have made him useful t.o many people, and he serves all three political parties at the same time, without any real loyalty to any, considering nothing but his own interest, working against Savonarola while pretending to be of his party, and even consenting to the death of Romola's godfather. He over-reaches himself, however, by arousing the resentment of Dolfo Spini whom he serves for his own ends, is attacked by Spini's followers, the Compagnacci, and, just as he succeeds in escaping from them, is found and killed by his deserted old father, the most sinned against of the many whom his selfishness has injured.",,Romola,,,,,"Melema, Tito",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Text,Encyclopedia of Places and Characters,0,0

He delivers the note, and is thus the one person who knows that Tito is aware that his father is alive. Although he has this knowledge, which might have saved his sister Romola from her disastrous marriage to Tito Melema, he does not warn her of it, but instead, when dying, gives her a visionary, mystical warning which merely distresses her.

""He was very different in aspect from his two fellow-prisoners… he had passed the boundary of old age, and could hardly be less that four or five and sixty. His beard which had grown long in neglect, and the hair which fell thick and straight round his baldness, were nearly white. His thickset figure was still firm and upright, though emaciated, and seemed to express energy in spite of age--and exptression that was partly carried out in the dark eyes and strong dark eyebrows, which had a strangely isolated intensity of colour in the midst of his yellow, bloodless, deep-wrinkled face with its lank grey hairs. And yet there was something fitful in the eyes, which contradicted the occasional flash of energy; after looking round with quick fierceness at windows and faces, they fell again with a lost and wandering look."" A great scholar and of ample means, he had adopted Tito Melema as a child and had brough him up as his own son. While journeying to Delos he is captured by pirates, though Tito, who carries their fortune in gems, escapes. Carried into captivity, he believes that his son will find and ransom him, and succeeds in sending Tito word of his whereabouts. After desertion and illness have broken him down, he is sent back to Italy, and, as a prisoner of the French, is brought to Florence, where Tito has been prospering since their separation. Near the Duomo he escapes from his guards and runs into Tito, who knows him, but denies him. Brooding over this treachery, he attempts to kill Tito when they meet again, and later, when his mental powers have returned temporarily, makes charges against Tito at the great supper in the Rucellai Gardens, but is again denied by Tito and again breaks down, and is cast into prison, where he languishes for two years, until released during the famine. Romola succours him and he seeks to enlist her aid against Tito, by telling her of Tito's ""other wife"", Tessa. Reduced to a pitiable condition by mental and physical suffering and forced to beg, he is kept alive only by the hope of vengeance. Eventually he finds Tito again, when the latter, worn out by his long swim to escape the mob, is cast ashore on the river bank, and he strangles Tito, dying himself immediately after. While Baldassarre Calvo is a fictitious character, there is an historical original for one of the events of his career. Villari, in his Life of Savonarola, tells of the escape of three prisoners at the time of the French entry into Florence who were liberated by the crowd just as in Romola. As this is the only printed source for this story, George Eliot undoubtedly took this incident from Villari, as Guido Biagi points out. (See Villari, Savonarola, p. 231; also Biagi edition of Romola.

She has led secluded life, devoted entirely to her blind father, whose secretary she is. She falls in love with Tito Melema almost at first sight, gives him her entire
trust as well as her love, and marries him, believing that he has the same high ideals as herself. Aside from her love for Tito, her devotion to her father is the strongest feeling in her life, and after his death she feels it a sacred obligation to carry out his wish to have his library preserved for the city of Florence. Although several things disturb her confidence in Tito, her eyes are not opened to his real character until he sells her father's library to the Duke of Milan in violation of what she considers a sacred trust. Believing that this shattering of her love releases her from her marriage vows, she decides to leave her husband, and is leaving Florence in disguise when she is stopped by Savonarola, who tells her that she can not thus break a sacred bond, and exhorts her to return and take up work for others if her personal happiness is gone. She yields to his influence, becomes one of his devoted followers, even though she does not accept all of his religious beliefs, and for several years spends herself in good works, staying with Tito, although their real separation in character and ideals becomes constantly more evident as Tito drifts from one treachery to another. When her godfather, Bernardo del Nero, is arrested, as she fears through Tito's treachery, and is executed in spite of her efforts to persuade Savonarola to save him, the limit of her endurance is  reached. Disappointed in Savonarola and grief-stricken at her godfather's death, she flees from Florence. By chance she reaches a plague-stricken village, and wins back peace and spiritual health by working among the sufferers. She returns to Florence just after Tito's death, and finds and cares for his two natural children and their mother. She is present at Savonarola's execution, and both then and during the rest of her life reveres him as a great religious leader who had helped her at a critical moment of her life. Romola, though nominally an Italian of the Renaissance, is so essentially an English Puritan that the suggestion has been made that some things in her character represent experiences of George Eliot's spiritual life. There is probably no ground for tracing a general resemblance, but in one respect, Romola's devotion to her father, there is, perhaps, a suggestion of a picture of George Eliot's affection for her father.",,Romola,,,,,"Bardi, Romola de'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Text,Encyclopedia of Places and Characters,0,0

In the act of bending, the cowl was pushed back, and the features of the monk had the full light of the tapers on them. They were very marked features, such as lend themselves to popular description.

He had no private malice—he sought no petty gratification. Even in the last terrible days, when ignominy, torture, and the fear of torture, had laid bare every hidden weakness of his soul, he could say to his importunate judges: 'Do not wonder if it seems to you that I have told but few things; for my purposes were few and great.' ""Savonarola, the great religious and political reformer of Florence, is the central figure in the historical part of Romola, and also, through the influence which he exerts over Romola herself, an important figure in the fictitious part of the plot. Romola first sees him at her brother's death-bed, but his principal connexion with her is when he meets her, on her attempted flight from her husband, and influences her by his exhortations to return to Tito and take up work for others though her personal happiness is gone. The main events in his career which figure in the novel are his preaching in the Duomo and elsewhere, his purification of the popular life of Florence, and his Bonfire of Vanities, the challenge which he receives from Fra Francesco and the attempted Trial by Fire, his last sermon and his arrest and execution. Girolamo Savonarola, the great Florentine reformer, was born at Ferrara in 1452; he came to Florence in 1489, was excommunicated 1497, and arrested and executed 1498. George Eliot's picture of Savonarola's career and influence in Florence follows closely the account in the standard biography, that of Pasquale Villari, and is both historically accurate and sympathetic. The importance of her portrait is attested by the fact that Romola is mentioned seriously in the preface to the revised edition of Villari, and is cited frequently in the later biography by Lucas.",,Romola,,,,,"Savonarola, Fra Girolamo (Hist.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Text,Encyclopedia of Places and Characters,0,0

When Bernardo del Nero is arrested Romola goes to San Marco to beg Savonarola for her godfather's life, and later Tito Melema goes to San Marco to obtain the letter by means of which he hopes to ruin Savonarola. After the proposed Trial by Fire, San Marco is attacked by the mob and Savonarola is arrested there. The famous Monastery, with the adjoining Church of San Marco, on the Piazza San Marco, was founded 1290 by the Silveetrini, and later, under Cosimo the Elder, was transferred to the Dominicans. In the fifteenth century the monastery was restored by Michelozzo and was decorated with frescoes by Fra Angelico da Fiesole. It was suppressed in 1867, and is now a museum.

"" Strangely Mamer's face and figure shrank and bent themselves into a constant mechanical relation to the objects of his life, so that he produced the same sort of impression as a handle or a crooked tube, which has no meaning standing apart. The prominent eyes that used to look trusting and dreamy, now looked as if they had been made to see only one kind of thing that was very small, like tiny grain, for which they hunted everywhere ; and he waa so withered and yellow, that, though he was not yet forty, the children always called him 'Old Master Marner '... Ch. ii. ""Yet few men could be more harmless than poor Marner. In his truthful simple soul, not even the growing greed and worship of gold could beget any vice directly injurious to others. The light of his faith quite put out, and his affections made desolate, he had clung with all the force of his nature to his work and his money; and like all objects to which a man devotes himself, they had fashioned him into correspondence with themselves. His loom, as he wrought in it without ceasing, had in its turn wrought on him, and confirmed more and more the monotonous craving for its monotonous response. His gold, as he hung over it and saw it grow, gathered his power of loving together into a hard isolation like its own."" In his youth he had been an artisan in a large manufacturing town where, in spite of the fact that he was subject to occasional cataleptic attacks, he led a contented life, his strong interests being his membership in a dissenting church, his friendship for William Dane, and his approaching marriage. Falsely accused of a robbery through his friend's treachery, and driven from church and home, he had wandered to Raveloe where he settled. With all faith in both men and religion lost through his cruel experience, he leads there a lonely life as a recluse and miser, his one pleasure the contemplation of the growing hoard of gold which he saves slowly by hard and constant toil. When his money is stolen, and the little golden-haired Eppie, an unclaimed child, comes, as he thinks, in place of the gold, he brings her up as his daughter, and through her needs and affection regains his joy in life. Note.—The plot of Silas Marner shows some marked resemblance to a Polish story by Kraszewski called Jermola the Potter. The similarity is most striking in the case of the central figure, Jermola, a deserted lonely old man left in poverty by the well-to-do family to which he had given a lifetime of service. Like Silas Marner, old Jermola finds a deserted infant near his hut, adopts it, and through love for it and the efforts which he has to make to support it, is restored to a happy and useful life. Unlike Silas, however, his life ends in tragedy, as the child is taken from him.

""When Maggie was not angry, she was as dependent on kind or cold words as a daisy on the sun shine or the cloud; the need of being loved would always subdue her."" As a child she is devoted to her brother Tom and passionately fond of her father, who takes her part when she rebels against the traditions of her mother and all the Dodsons. She leads a life of ups and downs, happy with her brother and her books or miserable in her attic to which she flies for refuge. After her father fails she is inspired by her reading of Thomas a Kempis to lead a life of self-renunciation and repression. In the Red Deeps she renews her friendship with Philip Wakem, the cripple, who had been at school with Tom. When he declares his love for her she mistakes affection for him for love. After some time her brother Tom discovers that she and Philip are meeting and brutally forces Maggie to renounce Philip. When, at nineteen, she has developed into a beauty with wonderful dark eyes, she meets her cousin Lucy's lover, Stephen Guest, and he falls in love with her. In spite of the fact that she is still fond of Philip she ends by returning Stephen's love, although struggling against it. While boating on the Floss they are accidentally carried too far by the tide, and Maggie at first thinks that she will yield to Stephen's desire to continue the journey and be married, but her better nature triumphs, and she leaves him to return courageously to her family. Her brother refuses to forgive her and disowns her. They are united only when they lose their lives together in the flood, when Maggie attempts to rescue Tom. ""Brother and sister had gone down in an embrace never to be parted; living through again in one supreme moment the days when they had clasped their hands in love, and roamed the daisied fields together."" The original of Maggie Tulliver, more particularly in childhood, was George Eliot herself, and the first part of the story is largely autobiographic. Mr. Cross says: ""No doubt the early part of Maggie's portraiture is the best autobiographical representation we can have of George Eliot's own feelings in her childhood, and many of the incidents in the book are based on real experiences of family life—but . . . mixed with fictitious elements and situations.""

""Mr. Tulliver was a strictly honest man, and proud of being honest, but he considered that in law the ends of justice could only be achieved by employing a stronger knave to frustrate a weaker. Law was a sort of cockfight, in which it was the business of injured honesty to get a game bird with the best pluck and the strongest spurs."" He is devoted to Maggie, ""the little wench,"" and generous to his less fortunate sister, Mrs. Moss, but his hot temper leads him into numerous lawsuits and eventually he loses Dorlcote Mill and becomes bankrupt. In order to save money for his creditors he manages the mill for his enemy, Lawyer Wakem, who has purchased it. When his debts are paid he gives way to his temper and hate, violently assaults Mr. Wakem. and dies from the shock to his enfeebled system. It has been suggeeted that a certain Tom Hollick, a farmer and miller of Nuneaton, whose mill George Eliot used to pass on her way to school, may have been the original of Mr. Tulliver. Hollick was described by one who remembered him as a sanguine high-tempered man, impatient of any attempt to impose upon him, who was involved in a lawsuit. (Manuscript information; also article in Great Thoughts, March, 1901, p. 370.)

""The Dodsons were certainly a handsome family, and Mrs. Glegg was not the least handsome of the sisters. ... no impartial observer could have denied that for a woman of fifty she had a very comely face and figure, though Tom and Maggie considered their aunt Glegg as the type of ugliness. It is true she despised the advantages of costume, for though, as she often observed, no woman had better clothes, it was not her way to wear her new things out before her old ones. Other women, if they liked, might have their best thread-lace in every wash, but when Mrs. Glegg died it would be found that she had better lace laid by in the righthand drawer of her wardrobe, in the Spotted Chamber, than ever Mrs. Wooll of St. Ogg's had bought in her life, although Mrs. Wooll wore her lace before it was paid for. So of her curled fronts: Mrs. Glegg had doubtless the glossiest and crispest brown curls in her drawers, as well as curls in various degrees of fuzzy laxness; but to look out on the week-day world from under a crisp and glossy front would be to introduce a most dreamlike and unpleasant confusion between the sacred and the secular. Occasionally, indeed, Mrs. Glegg wore one of her third-best fronts on a week-day visit, but not at a sister's house.""  She and her brother-in-law, Mr. TuUiver, frequently disagree, and she is disliked by the Tulliver children because of her disagreeable temper and domineering ways.

Stark in his History and Antiquities of Gainsburgh, p. 522, says of it: ""A curious phenomenon is observed in the Trent called the Eagre or Hygre. At spring tide the water rises on the surface of the river to a height of from seven to eight feet and rolls on in a large mass from the mouth of the Trent, considerably above the bridge. On account of the obstructions it meets with before it gets to Gainsburgh, the Eagre is some what diminished in size, but a few miles below the town it has a grand appearance."" At the time of the fall
equinox the Eagre is some times unusually high. For a description and picture of the Eagre during a very high equinoctial tide, see W. H.

A man of lofty and resolute purpose, capable of putting the claims of his people ahead of all personal considerations, he aspires to fuse together the scattered bands of Gypsies in Spain and lead them to found a Gypsy nation in Africa. At the opening of the poem he is held prisoner by the Spaniards in Bedmar, where he sees the beautiful Fedalm.a, the Duke's betrothed, and recognizes her as his long lost daughter, who had been stolen in childhood by marauding Spaniards. Revealing himself to her, he sets before her the claims of her race and so works upon her with his force and eloquence that she agrees to leave Duke Silva, whom she loves devotedly, and to escape with her father and devote herself to the welfare of her race. After Duke Silva, unable to bear the loss of Fedalma, follows her to the Gypsy camp and for her sake joins the Gypsy band, deserting his post at Bedmar, Zarca, and his Moorish ally, El Zagal, attack and capture Bedmar. Zarca shows some moderation in his victory, although he condemns the inquisitor, Father Isidor, to death, and when Silva, frantic at Father Isidor's death and the thought that the loss of the town is due to his desertion of his post, stabs Zarca, the Gypsy protects him and will not allow his people to harm Silva. Dying, Zarca lays upon Fedalma the solemn duty of taking his place in the leadership of his people. Frederic Harrison has suggested that some traits in the character of Zarca were drawn from Dr. Richard Congreve, the Positivist leader. (See article in the Positivist Review, vol. 10, p. 160.)
