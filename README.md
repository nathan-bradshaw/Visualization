## Features

### Expandable Boxes
Each work has a box that will expand into a menu consisting of Characters, Places, and Other Named Entities. To investigate a work, simply click on the expand button underneath the desired work. To collapse a work, click the expand button again.

The “Show More” button will give a description of the work chosen. To collapse this description, click “Show Less”. For each item category, you can click the category name and see all of the items in that category.

To learn more about an item, you can click on the item and a popup box will give you a description of that item.

### Search Bar
In the top left, there is a search bar that you can type into. After the first character in the search bar, there will be a list of suggestions that match your search. The path that you see is ordered as follows: “Title of Work/Category/Item”. The search bar will only match your typed characters with the Item part of the path. When you select the item that you are looking for, it will bring you straight to the popup box with the description.
